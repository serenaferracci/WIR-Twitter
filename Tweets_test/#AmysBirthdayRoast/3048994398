I finally made it to a full year and a half clean, As of midnight, Tonight. I never thought that I would be away from heroin. 27 brought me Chronic Heart Failure, A broken elbow in 6 places, and a broken engagement. I hope 28 brings HAPPIER times! CHEERS! ❤️ #AmysBirthdayRoast https://t.co/Q5ZE4pGBvS
