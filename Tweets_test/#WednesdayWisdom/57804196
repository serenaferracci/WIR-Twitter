What can we say about Chase? Well first off he's in kennels in #Essex &amp; does NOT belong there. He recently undertook a 9 hr journey &amp; was so patient &amp; kind &amp; never made a murmur. He's an absolute cracker💖🙏 @ADogsTale1 https://t.co/vAoUHJjQm6 #woofwoofwednesday #WednesdayWisdom https://t.co/Pyj3oHm5pN
