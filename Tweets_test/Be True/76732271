NEW YORK: There are more non-Jews than orthodox Jews at the #CelebrateIsrael #TogetherOnFifth #Parade. You don't have to be a Jewish to be a Zionist...
(you actually CAN'T be true to your Judaism and support Zionism).
Orthodox Jews now at a mass #KinesKluli rally AGAINST Zionism! https://t.co/ZpGKAuVD3o
