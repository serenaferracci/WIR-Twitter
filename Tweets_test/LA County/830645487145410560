CRITICAL LA COUNTY INFORMATION:

Printing errors kept almost 120k voters off the lists at polling places in 1500+ precincts.

If you’re not on the list, ASK FOR A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. If workers won’t give you one, or you have other problems, call (877) 321-VOTE (8683) right away. https://t.co/v6nD1MltQH
