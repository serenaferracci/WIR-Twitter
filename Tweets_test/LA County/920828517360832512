ALERT: Almost 120,000 voters were omitted from voter rosters in LA County due to a printing error. If your name is not on the list, STAY IN LINE. You will still be able to vote by provisional ballot. 

Don't let this affect the election results. Make sure your vote is counted! https://t.co/ci7Xxj7iur
