74 years ago today, the #DDay landings took place. Last week Charlie &amp; I discovered where his great-grandfather came ashore on Juno Beach, where his rendezvous point was &amp; when he arrived at Pegasus Bridge. We found him in the museum! @BaileyofBristol @Media_CAMC #LestWeForget https://t.co/OUJeWtKN8M
