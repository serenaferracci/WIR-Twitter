@xxxxPORTERxxxx @RVAStreetMedia @jaketapper @JonahNRO @Kaepernick7 @Eagles Black on black crime is a myth and i wish yall would stop spouting that bullshit on the net without doing research. It’s just crime , crime happens that’s it that’s all. Crime happens in proximity. When whites kill each other they don’t call it “white on white crime”
