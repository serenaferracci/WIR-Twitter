The one-time powerhouse retailer that survived two world wars and the Great Depression has been calving off pieces of itself as it burns through money. #Sears #storeclosing #retail https://t.co/cyQ5O1BatO
@carolhagen @amazon Seems to me  #Sears thought  that their name alone would continue to draw in customers Nope, you have to keep up with and move ahead with the times &amp; Sears definately didn't do that The rise &amp; downfall of a company that refused to have a realistic vision of the future

Please buy your appliances at #Sears, it has always been an American tradition. I stopped buying appliances at Homedepot and Lowes.

It's interesting that #Sears struggles so much in today's market considering they got their start with the Sears catalog â€“â€“ an almost all encompassing catalog that was literally the Amazon of its day.
#Sears #plans to #shutter 72 more #stores, with closing sales starting in the near #future

#Sears is still living in the past. They havenâ€™t updated their business model in a very long time clearly, and their marketing team sucks. If they were smarter they couldâ€™ve actually worked to make a change. I honestly donâ€™t care that theyâ€™re closing stores. ðŸ‘‹

At #Sears, things aren't looking good. Revenue dropped more than 30 percent to $2.89 billion, with store closings already under way contributing to almost two thirds of the decline.
