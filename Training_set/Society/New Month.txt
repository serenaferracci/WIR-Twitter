Funny thing about Twitter...

The more followers I add, the more my follower count decreases.

For years, I added many, usually hundreds, of new followers each day.

All of a sudden, starting about one month ago, I have a net loss every day.

Welp, it’s officially my birthday month!
It’s 9:30am, and I’m not a morning person so that’s about as scintillating as I’m gonna get right now.

Let’s agree that none of the sub-units would be anything w/o the other. LOONA is the girlgroup known to reveal a new girl every month. Although each sub-unit has a different concept, they are all united. And the only thing that matters is the girls will love &amp; support each other https://t.co/5C4tpPAhG3
New month. 
Same goals.
More ambition.
Who’s ready?

New month X new money 🤗
@GooglePlay why don't you have the new Kanye West album ready for subscribers? It's available to buy. That's whack. I pay 10 a month to get new music. I want the new album up without me having to pay EXTRA for something I ALREADY pay for.
So annoying in horror movies when it takes the new family like one day to completely move into, paint, clean and decorate a new house, and then over a month of terrifying occurrences to get the fuck out
Hello JUNE! May this month be filled with new blessings, new opportunities, more love, more life, and great vibes. May the last half of this year be full of magic!

It's midyear already. Time flies so fast!! 😊
Practical tips for starting a new month on the right foot: 📆
