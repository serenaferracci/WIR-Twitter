Nobody hates the warriors or Steph curry, Draymond green, or Klay Thompson for being great. They hate them for being an obstacle to Lebron and they hate KD even more for making the obstacle insurmountable. Has nothing to do with y‚Äôall wantin parity y‚Äôall just wanna see Lebron win

@mnolin19 @MovistarNBA La diferencia entre Warriors y Cavs es abismal, en los Warriors tanto Curry como Durant como Klay pueden estar peor, aparecen otros. Lebron no se puede dar ni un respiro en todo el partido, no hay nadie m√°s que tire del carro. Todo lo que no sea el MVP para Lebron es un esc√°ndalo
I hate to say it, but the officials had a MAJOR role in the outcome of this game.  People invest their hard earned money and time to watch these athletes play and incompetent officials ruin the game.

Klay Thompson a loup√© 20 matchs dans sa carri√®re. Si y‚Äôen a bien un de solide qui fait flipper en grin√ßant des dents, c‚Äôest lui.
It is remarkable that, with everything else that happened, Klay Thompson played 39:38 of the final 41 minutes of the game after it looked he might have suffered a gruesome leg injury. A ridiculous performance.
Klay is back !!

What a great #NBAFinals Game 1. We got a close game that featured an inspiring performance from LeBron James. But in the end, the Warriors got clutch performance from the Steph, Klay, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson and the referees.
klay thompson is so fineeeeee
@NakedEyeSports @PatrickHMast @NBAOfficial @NBATV All this happened after that pivotal call. So half of this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if it the call stayed a charge. LeBrons pass would‚Äôve been clean to Hill but Klay grabbed him. Bron still had 5 seconds to drive to the bucket on Steph. Hill got open so the right play was made.
Klay Thompson splashes a 3, giving him 293 playoff triples, moving him past Kobe Bryant (292) and into sixth place on the all-time list.
