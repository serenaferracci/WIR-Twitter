Kenya's  Wyclife Kinyamal 🇰🇪 is slowly taking that 800m crown from David Rudisha...another victory in the @Diamond_League #RomeDL
It's official! The fastest 400m hurdles time we have ever seen in the Diamond League😱

What a competition it's been and what a talent this man is!

He had to dig very deep but Fred Kerley just takes a great win in the men's 400m with 44.33, holding off a resurgent Abdalelah Haroun who can only finish slightly behind with 44.37!

Che #Tortu! 10”04 e 3º posto!
A un centesimo dal personale della settimana scorsa a Savona e davanti a #Coleman.

Echevarria not so much over the board as taking off from in the sand pit, there. #RomeDL
Podestplatz für die Schweiz: 22,76 und Platz 3 für @Mujinga_ über 200m in #RomeDL! @UBSathletics @Diamond_League @srfsport @RTSsport @RSIsport https://t.co/A2TQK9dZNL
22.49 for @majo10s70 to win 200m. #RomeDL
Confirmation of that brilliant 3000m steeplechase meeting record from Hyvin Kiyeng, adding to the feast of stunning times we are being treated to tonight!

When you’re in remote Slovenia and have what seems like 11 channels of folk music but no Eurosport,  there’s no finer substitute for #GoldenGala #ROMEDL updates than @drdanoconnor’s timeline.
Like a true champion @samkendricks pulled it out of the bag when he needed it. A 5.84m jump proves too much for Poland's Wojciechowski to match, as the world champion takes the victory to open his Diamond League account this season!

Giuro che non guardo l'atletica solo perché le atlete sono belle. Giuro.

L’Italienne Marie-Josée Ta Lou remporte le 200 m en 22,49 s, à Rome, en Italie. La Canadienne @CrystalEmm91 a terminé 5e avec un temps de 23,08 s.

🚨Unbelievable! @almbrek96 bags a phenomenal 400m Hurdles win in 47.48, which is not just a meeting record but:

✅Personal Best
✅Area Record
✅World Lead

Not bad for the young Qatari!

is there just a drawer somewhere back at IAAF HQ marked "distractingly handsome pole vaulters"? #RomeDL

Kind of routine win for Ta Lou in the 200m, but had to hold off Lalova-Collio and Kambundji to take it. #GoldenGala #DiamondLeague #RomeDL
As he prepares for another tough two lap contest, Poland's @AdamKszczot is certainly not a man to rule out. We'll see what he can do in a strong 800m men's competition coming up at 20:38pm local time!

Ta Lou sigue brava: 22'49s en 200m #RomeDL
World silver medalist Salwa Eid Naser finds the extra push to hold off Stephenie Mcpherson and take the women's 400m in a season's best of 50.51

Nigerian-born Bahrain athlete, Salwa Eid Naser did not cave in under pressure from Stephanie McPherson as she held on to win the women's 400m with an SB of 50.51s #RomeDL #GoldenGala
.@majo10s70 was simply too good. The world silver medallist pulls away down the home straight for a dominant victory in the women's 200m with 22.49 season's best ahead of Ivet Lalova-Collio with 22.64!

#RomeDL #DiamondLeague #RoadToTheFinal https://t.co/4z0P7fvKeh
So far in the women’s high jump Mariya Lasitskene is the only athlete clear of 1.97m. Will she match the world lead of 2.01m by Belgium’s @thiam_nafi?
