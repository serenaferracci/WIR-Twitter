Warriors in 4

Partido 2: Lebron 65 pts pero Tyron Lue le sienta los tres últimos cuartos

Partido 3: Lebron 82 pts pero Tristan Thompson salta antes de tiempo y tapona el tiro decisivo

Partido 4: Lebron 126 pts pero sus compañeros le apalean en el vestuario y no puede jugar
@KB0824KB @ripthefranchise @squadric @Chris_Smoove A former referee literally said at least 2 calls were different than what these trash ass refs said and the flagrant foul on Tristan was so stupid and Livingston didn’t attempt to engage because he didn’t do shit

Holy shit. Draymond Green went up to Tristan Thompson and said Khloe kardashian smells like a jimmy johns sandwich, Tristan throws the ball in draymonds face and calls him a “small baller” and massive brawl ensues. Didn’t see that coming
Lebron to Jr Smith and Tristan Thompson after Game 1: 

#CavsWarriors https://t.co/2kzlg493iC
Bron threatened Cavs front office into giving JR and Tristan that contract. You made your bed
If Tristan gets suspended...you dress and start Perkins.... he knocks out as many Warriors as he can... he walks off the floor for the last time....and we hang his jersey in the rafters in Cleveland forever.
draymond said drake a better dad than tristan thompson
Remember: Draymond Green can literally try to gouge a man's eye out, and it was a standard foul. Tristan Thompson throws a loose elbow is ejected. Glad the NBA is 100 percent fair and balanced
Can we not do this? I wouldn't suspend Tristan either for connecting with Draymond's face. He meant to shove the ball at him, and the refs let Draymond taunt the world for 10 minutes. Let these guys play, please. https://t.co/UhpedRAI82
Tristan Thompson teve coragem de trair a esposa grávida, não teria coragem pra meter a bola na cara do D. Green....

Tristan Thompson is locked into a prison-sentence relationship with a Kardashian. He has nothing to live for. Draymond better back the fuck up ASAP

4) Tristan getting thrown out for contesting a shot is ridiculous. 
5) Why didn’t Draymond get a 2nd technical for waving at Tristan?

Tristan thrown out for an alleged elbow but taunting goes unnoticed &amp; he is right in your face https://t.co/ZwgsAMpmnv
Kevin Love told me he left the bench in OT to argue the call on Tristan, walking onto the court to get in the officials' eyeline, not in reaction to any scuffle &amp; before it even broke out. Video (via @bballbreakdown) seems to back this up; not sure if it will matter to the league https://t.co/JeHmd6Fl2p
Can we not do this? I wouldn't suspend Tristan either for connecting with Draymond's face. He meant to shove the ball at him, and the refs let Draymond taunt the world for 10 minutes. Let these guys play, please. https://t.co/UhpedRAI82

Tristan got ejected for no reason and Draymond Green got to parade around the arena taunting the entire Cavaliers team for 5+ minutes. 
No player in the NBA is reffed the same as Green. His rope with the officials is as long as the day the minute he picks up his first tech
