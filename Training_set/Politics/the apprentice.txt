How you get a pardon: 

D'Souza: "I read the papers - I see him on television."

Blagojevich: "I don't know him other than he was on The Apprentice"

Martha Stewart: "she used to be my biggest fan in the world" https://t.co/U7IflK6E9C
Jacquelyn Stout was selected as a Summer Art Apprentice at the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame, a highly competitive paid internship. Congratulations! https://t.co/7a25fXChPh
"There is always a gap between being an apprentice and being a craftsman. The apprentice has the taste, but not the skill. The craftsman has the taste and the skill." - @james_clear
Martha Stewart, meanwhile, hits the Trump bingo: a) hosted a The Apprentice spinoff; b) was prosecuted by James Comey; c) was convicted of lying to the FBI and obstruction of justice.
So, if you've been a contestant or host on The Apprentice and you've committed a federal crime, you're in luck. https://t.co/1PbcYep1XD
BREAKING: Trump just said he may pardon Martha Stewart and commute disgraced former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's sentence. Stewart did a spin-off series of The Apprentice and Blagojevich was on Celebrity Apprentice. He‚Äôs laying the groundwork so he can really abuse pardon powers.
@samstein I understand former Illinois Gov Blago and Martha Stewart,  members of the Apprentice family tree, are up next....no, seriously.

Trump considering pardons for Martha Stewart, Rod Blagojevich. Stewart, convicted of obstructing justice in 2004, hosted 'The Apprentice' spinoff that Trump produced. Blagojevich, the ex-Illinois governor serving 14 years for corruption, was a 'Celebrity Apprentice' contestant.

@realDonaldTrump to pardon every disreputable, racist scumbag that ever broke the law. Oh yeah and some people who did the Apprentice. God help us survive our insane, ridiculous reality TV Presidency. https://t.co/yW9sEOWt1L
@TheMikeDubin It's more like an anti-Survivor. "YOU are voted BACK onto the island!"

The way Trump RIPPED Martha Stewart for her version of the Apprentice, calling it inferior... I'm shocked he wants to pardon her now, lol.

les deux is the same club where: lindsay lohan would party the night of her very first DUI, lauren conrad &amp; heidi montag engaged in their infamous "you know what you did!" fight on the hills, and trump hosted an 'apprentice' finale party - all in 2007. the history is endless.

Someone needs to run a list of Apprentice contestants and known Trump friends that are in jail and see if we can predict when he will next show his contempt for justice and the rule of law by pardoning one of them.

The Trump pardon of Dinesh D'Souza proves that this president desires to be an authoritarian leader, just pardoning anybody who says nice things about him. Now he's looking at pardoning a couple of The Celebrity Apprentice stars. He's turning this into a Banana Republic.

@Slate @MarthaStewart is NOT a Apprentice spin-off star, and she should of never been jailed in the first place. Also, @POTUS is an orange turd
Just to be clear- we had ‚ÄúThe Apprentice x KUWTK‚Äù meeting at the White House to discuss prison reform. I don‚Äôt EVER wanna hear y‚Äôall tell an athlete to stick to sports ever again. If Kim K can meet with the president on prison reform, athletes can talk politics too ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Martha Stewart, also obviously guilty, was one of the rare occasions where someone at her level ACTUALLY faced accountability and was an example for other powerful people that they're not above the law. She hosted an Apprentice spinoff. Now Trump wants to pardon her. Uh huh.

In '06, Martha &amp; Trump had a spat over her version of the Apprentice. Martha went on her daughter's SiriusXM show &amp; said:
"He's a spoiled brat"
"Remember Donald was born with a silver spoon in his mouth."
Daughter Alexis replied "Or up his ass." https://t.co/hqrcsqOCJe https://t.co/NuZzK8OEwp

@RickPetree In June 2015 Lewandowski told me point black that Trump had Ailes &amp; Zucker in his back pocket.  I didn't believe him.  But Zucker greenlit The Apprentice when head of entertainment at NBC owes his career to Trump. He only knows entertainment not news. He handed CNN reins to Trump
Liberal media thinks DJT is abusing his power of the pardon! Say what you want at least NONE of these people being considered/pardoned by President @realDonaldTrump was a rapist, drug dealer or killer like the last admin pardoned "Celebrity Apprentice" #GreatAwakening #ExDem #KAG

What REALLY bothers me today is that I NEVER watched the Apprentice. I can't stand Donald Trump, for years, have always found him odious. But I can't just change the channel-he invades my life as he shatters every ideal I learned in civics class.

This, a thousand times this. People do not grasp how central Zucker and CNN were in creating the trump presidency.  I'll go so far to say Zucker is more responsible than Putin for creating trump via Apprentice and then CNN. And it was all about ratings, i.e. making money. SICK. https://t.co/smuD985V1v
