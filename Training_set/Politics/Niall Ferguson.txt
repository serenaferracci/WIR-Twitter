"Niall Ferguson" used students to...do opposition research on an opponent!!!  The horror! The (manufactured) outage that will be needed to make this a thing!
More interesting to me: John Rice-Cameron, the son of Barack Obama’s former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, was equally grandiose. “Slowly, we will continue to crush the Left’s will to resist, as they will crack under pressure,” https://t.co/FhEzoTwJEo

The reason why so many academics are upset about Niall Ferguson's behavior deserves a little explanation.

It's not political. It's about an abuse of power. https://t.co/cvMtrJEOWF

Ferguson teamed up with a group of student Republicans... to wage a covert political battle against Michael Ocon, a student they viewed as excessively left-wing. In the e-mails they refer to Ocon as “Mr. O” and talk about ways to discredit him. https://t.co/Ljt7x8LQpe

Daughter #2 will be attending a college with an aggressive republican group. She's beautiful. I told her to grab all the hot girls, and definitely not attend. Go somewhere else, call a big party and ignore them. Definitely never invite them. Is that bad?

I think it's pretty safe to say that Niall Ferguson qualifies as a literary depiction of an academic villain.
