Government is a promise to everyone, and the most important promise to the most vulnerable. 

This was always important, and right now, it's more important than ever. #CfASummit https://t.co/4Zwutjdj3L
american politics may be genuinely dispiriting right now, but i‚Äôm legitimately inspired by the small teams, like the VA Digital Service, who are diligently chipping away at decades-old problems and upholding our promises to veterans and our fellow americans. #CfASummit https://t.co/kSCstcaPLZ
Agile can still be challenging for those who fear the unknown. The devil you know and all. But w have to be persistent. "We have to assess our small wins, on a daily basis, and be aware of the potholes ahead." -Amy Tong #CfASummit

Amy Tong arrived in California 30 years ago with her family and 8 suitcases. Now she is the state‚Äôs CIO. California‚Äôs public services were vital to her journey. Lets digitize these services for those who need it most. #cfasummit https://t.co/1xIfnY59Ik
I had to read a lot of tweets before I realized #CfASummit is not a meeting  of Chick-Fil-A franchisees,
üì£The biggest three words in government service UX:

‚û°Ô∏è "What happens next" ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

If your service doesn't make this crystal clear to users, you need to redesign it.

(That's why Case Companion answers this exact question as often as possible.) #CfASummit https://t.co/Xqu35rGjt9

"I can't do this but I'm doing it anyway." @hondanhon's t-shirt reminds us why we have to step up to important work even if we don't feel ready. As @pahlkadot says, "No one is coming. It is up to us." #CfASummit https://t.co/iGrVZK8Scf

Most innovation is not "new to world". It's bringing old ideas from other industries to your industry. Interdisciplinary practice is so cool. Glad to see so many folks bringing Agile and User centered design to government #CfASummit
I really like a phrase @rodneymullen just used at #CfASummit: "sustainable failure". Reminds me of something @daeaves said at last summit: "You can iterate from the start, or you can iterate after you fail." Iteration = sustainable failure.

Incredible and emotionally moving set of #CfASummit talks on using tech and policy to reform criminal justice systems and veterans services. Let's make government services work for those who need them most! üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è
Really troubled of the use of  "citizens" in the #CfASummit talks to describe the persons in our communities that we serve
Amy says @CADeptTech is embracing the iterative process of Agile. "If something isn't working the way you want, have the guts to change it." #CfASummit

#CFASummit Lots of discussion about "users". In gov't IT work sometimes the user is the end-client - citizen, soldier, homeless person but often "user" is the agency employee. Our systems must work well for both.
