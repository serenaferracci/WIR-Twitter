Every word, every frame, every moment of #TheAmericans finale was breathtakingly perfect. I can’t remember the last time I’ve been so completely satisfied with a series finale. If this show doesn’t win every Golden Globe &amp; Emmy available, the world will have officially gone mad. https://t.co/7k47xszooD
