In '06, Martha &amp; Trump had a spat over her version of the Apprentice. Martha went on her daughter's SiriusXM show &amp; said:
"He's a spoiled brat"
"Remember Donald was born with a silver spoon in his mouth."
Daughter Alexis replied "Or up his ass." https://t.co/hqrcsqOCJe https://t.co/NuZzK8OEwp
