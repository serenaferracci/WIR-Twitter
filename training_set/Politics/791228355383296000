Thursday in #Gouda can only mean one thing - Gouda Cheese Market! On from 10am - 1pm, this was the main reason I visited Gouda and it did not disappoint! I loved seeing how a traditional cheese deal goes down and stocking up on cheese! @HeleendeWinter @VVVGouda #ThursdayThoughts https://t.co/LqSEHWipIb
