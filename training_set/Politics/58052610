“Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!” - President @realDonaldTrump tweeted and it was #BreakingNews. In my opinion it’s fair and @DineshDSouza deserves it. Congratulations and Thanks Pres. https://t.co/veqSJqsYSr https://t.co/M6V1r11dtH
