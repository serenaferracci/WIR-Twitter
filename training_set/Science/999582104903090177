The @ArtofLiving along with the #Maharashtra Govt. are developing 10 model villages in Jalna district. A month of dedicated work from our volunteers has resulted in 11,000 m of continuous counter trenches. This will help watershed management &amp; benefit farmers Â in the coming days. https://t.co/40Xifvyuyr
