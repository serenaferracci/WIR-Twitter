#EndAlzheimers💜June is “Go Purple” for Alzheimer’s &amp; Brain Awareness Month. Just a little #EndALZ in your daily prayers for those afflicted &amp; their caregivers would be great. I’m so proud of my daddy’s attitude in the face of such adversity &amp; look at each day as a gift💜 https://t.co/tETlZHHNdN
