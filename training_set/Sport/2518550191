@NakedEyeSports @PatrickHMast @NBAOfficial @NBATV All this happened after that pivotal call. So half of this wouldn’t have happened if it the call stayed a charge. LeBrons pass would’ve been clean to Hill but Klay grabbed him. Bron still had 5 seconds to drive to the bucket on Steph. Hill got open so the right play was made.
