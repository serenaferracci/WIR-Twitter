My house in Boise, Idaho is ready to #WearOrange for National Gun Violence Awareness Day and the first day of Pride month because 96 lives taken each day is unacceptable, and we can do better. @MomsDemand is here to show you how. Text ORANGE to 644-33 to find an event near you. https://t.co/k9JxfB5U97
