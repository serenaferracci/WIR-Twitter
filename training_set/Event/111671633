Today begins #WearOrange weekend to raise awareness about gun violence. Iâ€™ll be wearing orange &amp; speaking at @MomsDemand action event tmrw in Miami to support all the grieving families, specially my cousin, MJ Wright, who lost her son, Jerry, to gun violence at #Pulse shooting.ðŸ§¡ https://t.co/2qmt0KwPGP
