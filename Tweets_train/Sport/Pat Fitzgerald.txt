Jim Comey prosecuted Martha Stewart, and Comey’s best friend Pat Fitzgerald prosecuted Blagojevich and Scooter Libby. 

It's as if Trump is building a squad of convicted felons who'll unite with him to battle the evil villain, Federal Prosecution.
Very curious who is connecting the dots for him here. It's like he's working through a list trying to undo cases brought by either Comey or Comey's friends (Blago would be the second Pat Fitzgerald case). https://t.co/A7CgVNkieT

Trump blatantly signals his willingness to abuse the pardon power in ways that could also help out friends in trouble. Stewart was convicted of lying &amp; obstruction. Blago was convicted by Comey friend Pat Fitzgerald of taking a bribe. Lawful but awful.  https://t.co/JwCjySACAi

What's the pattern w/ pardoning Libby &amp; D'Souza, floating Stewart &amp; Blagojevich? Celebrity + white collar + undoing big wins by enemies (prosecutors were Comey, his lawyer Pat Fitzgerald, &amp; fired SDNY US atty @PreetBharara). Who else fits? Maybe Conrad Black, another Fitz case...

Ok this crazy -not only were Blagojevich &amp; "Martha" both on Apprentice - but (as TerryMoran points out): 
D’Souza was prosecuted by Preet Bharara, Stewart was prosecuted by Comey. 
Blago was prosecutd by Pat Fitzgerald, who also prosecuted Scooter Libby&amp; now reps COMEY. Mindblown
