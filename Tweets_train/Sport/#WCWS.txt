The pitching takeaway from the #WCWS is you don't need a ton of different pitches. Instead, you need a few pitches you can throw to either edge &amp; a great change.
Legendary coach and namesake of the #Sooners home field, Marita Hynes, taking in today's games.

Lives in Riudoso, New Mexico now, but says she still texts with Patty Gasso, who she hired back before the 1995 season, "all the time."
