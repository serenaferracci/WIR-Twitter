Adding 223,000 jobs in May is a good #JobsReport. I wish Trump and the Republicans would have acknowledged that on any of the 4 previous Mays in the Obama administration when that happened. https://t.co/kVDu6AQb4n

@RedTRaccoon Seeing as Democrats found it fitting to not applaud historically low unemployment rates for minorities at the SOTU and still now, they obviously have no interest in working with @POTUS to better the economy. Sad.

“Why do we need more laws? Criminals, by definition, don’t follow them”.
