Trump’s Dinesh D’Souza pardon today, on top of his pardons of Scooter Libby and Joe Arpaio, make sense only as an elephant-whistle to Michael Cohen &amp; all who know damning things about Trump: protect me &amp; I’ll have your back. Turn on me &amp; your goose is cooked. More obstruction!
Dinesh D'Souza, Convicted Felon Pardoned By Trump, Has Done Some Vile Things

D’Souza has literally defended Adolf Hitler. https://t.co/YD1WUqR6jr
Not that it affects the legal case, but Dinesh D’Souza’s twitter feed looks like Roseanne’s x 1,000 and is what he’s been known for in recent years. There’s a separate message getting sent there too with this pardon. https://t.co/aDKjkqYiXT
The staggering corruption of Dinesh D’Souza’s pardon https://t.co/HlZB5k9NU5
“KARMA IS A BITCH DEPT: @PreetBharara wanted to destroy a fellow Indian American to advance his career. Then he got fired &amp; I got pardoned.” –Dinesh D’Souza https://t.co/zgHXfo8aCJ
Trump pardoned:

Joe Arpaio—Contempt of court

Scooter Libby—Perjury

Dinesh D’Souza—Election law violations

Trump is reportedly considering pardoning/commuting sentence for:

Martha Stewart—Obstruction of justice

Rod Blagojevich—Corruption

@realDonaldTrump’s message is clear.
The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico
Trump pardons Dinesh D'Souza https://t.co/pitaNSi26r #FoxNews Awesome! Thank you, POTUS. Now, let's see further justice done by putting the Obama Admin. bosses of bosses in prison.

Obama used IRS to target political enemies. The democrats keep screaming about Russia, the Russians are nothing compared to the tactics of the democrats.

A very VERY good distillation of why it's hard to think of anyone less deserving of a pardon than Dinesh D'Souza. Zero remorse, baseless charges of political prosecution, serial liar and generally terrible person. https://t.co/QtT6jpGyW0
@maggieNYT So Trump had never heard of Dinesh D’Souza until last night, pardons him today and states no one asked him to do it. 👀👀 He knows we have brain activity, right?
Oh look: the man the president pardoned and who Ted Cruz just praised, fomenting the same vile anti-semitic lie that Roseanne was tweeting. What a coincidence! 

https://t.co/kASRrtWwtM
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
Dinesh D’Souza is also an accused domestic batterer btw
Dinesh D’Souza is an awful person. Today is a good reminder that there will be so much more unfairness before this is over. We’re not ready for it.
The Obama Administration sent Dinesh D'Souza to jail for a $10,000 political campaign contribution

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it

Funny how @PreetBharara is having a meltdown over POTUS pardoning Dinesh D’Souza because “he broke the law” yet this is the same guy who magically couldn’t find a crime in the Clinton Foundation. 🤔
Dinesh D'Souza, admittedly crazy, makes a movie that embarrasses Clinton. So the government scours his entire life for evidence of some crime and finds an FEC violation.  @Styx666Official
In light of Trump's pardon of Dinesh D'Souza, reposting:

To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋

Today Trump has continued to "Drain the Swamp" by pardoning Dinesh D'Souza.  

Because nothing says, "I am removing corruption from politics," like forgiving a man who funneled money through 3rd parties in order to circumvent election laws written to protect our democracy.

Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

Trump's pardon of Dinesh D'Souza undermines the rule of law &amp; makes a mockery of our democracy.

Trump’s pardon of D’Souza goes against the entire reason of the pardon existing, to correct the wrongs that may occur in dispensing justice.

Dinesh D’Souza pled Guilty to federal campaign finance violations for running a straw donor ring to support a Republican candidate. https://t.co/WB2Ty6jeHa
In pardoning the well-documented criminality of folks like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, President Trump is sending a clear message: Personal loyalty to his administration will secure legal immunity.

Dinesh D’Souza literally donated thousands of dollars under other people's names to a politician, breaking campaign finance laws.

Trump's pardon opens the door for others to do the same.

Trump undermines the sanctity of our elections while claiming Mueller is Meddling in them.
Pardoning Dinesh D'Souza is nothing short of outright circumvention of the American justice system.  NO American should have greater legal protections over any other.  

#elitism #swampy #maga
To be clear who Dinesh D’Souza is....he pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. He sends out heinously racist, anti-Semitic messaging. He peddles conspiracy theories. He has literally made fun of teenage school shooting survivors. This adulterer is getting a pardon.

In case you were wondering what Dinesh D’Souza is.👇🏾 https://t.co/aPOQvSs48T
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
Wow! WE FINALLY have a bi-partisan, NON-biased President! 
After pardoning, Patriot Dinesh D'Souza, President Trump has announced that he is considering doing the same for Trump Hater, Martha Stewart &amp; ex Democrat Governor Rod Blagojevich!
EAT your hearts out #Fakenews &amp; HATERS! https://t.co/OxFAWzMTxv
Dinesh D’Souza isn’t worth my time. I’m going to celebrate Health care for people in Va and NJ
Trump’s pardon of D’Souza goes against the entire reason of the pardon existing, to correct the wrongs that may occur in dispensing justice.

Dinesh D’Souza pled Guilty to federal campaign finance violations for running a straw donor ring to support a Republican candidate. https://t.co/WB2Ty6jeHa
Never forget that Dinesh D’Souza unapologetically tweeted this right after the murder of Trayvon Martin. https://t.co/Df1cB55aFH
Conservative provocateur Dinesh D’Souza says he’s “relieved” to have his “record clean” after Trump pardons him.
 
Watch another Trump pardon recipient, Joe Arpaio, learn that accepting a pardon is actually an *admission of guilt* https://t.co/9y1kr1wArD
Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico

President Donald Trump: "Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!" May 31, 2018
Dinesh D'Souza:
Said of Barrack Obama "you can take the boy out of the ghetto"
Called Michelle Obama "affirmative action" Princeton student
Said slavery wasn't racist, slaves were treated "pretty well"
Minimized Rosa Parks' legacy 
Mocked the Parkland school shooting survivors
The Obama Administration sent Dinesh D'Souza to jail for a $10,000 political campaign contribution

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"

In pardoning the well-documented criminality of folks like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, President Trump is sending a clear message: Personal loyalty to his administration will secure legal immunity.

It can't be overstated how subversive this is to a functioning democracy. https://t.co/oqxuei9pIa
BREAKING NEWS: President @realDonaldTrump announced Thursday he will pardon conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who was convicted of making an illegal campaign contribution in 2012. https://t.co/Ljs84gTYyN
lol remember when Dinesh D’Souza said the 9/11 terrorists were brave warriors 

and then kicked and beat his wife so badly that she is still suffering from her injuries 

and then committed campaign finance fraud and is now a convicted felon? https://t.co/wT6gfUiBI6
Not that it affects the legal case, but Dinesh D’Souza’s twitter feed looks like Roseanne’s x 1,000 and is what he’s been known for in recent years. There’s a separate message getting sent there too with this pardon. https://t.co/aDKjkqYiXT
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara The @POTUS has the right to pardon but here are the facts:

➖D'Souza intentionally broke the law
➖Voluntarily pled guilty
➖Apologized for his conduct
➖Judge found no unfairness
➖Career prosecutors and @FBI agents did their job—PERIOD
@PreetBharara 

https://t.co/5NPzX2K1Pj
To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Refugee parents who are following asylum law to the letter are having their children kidnapped and held for ransom by our government.

Meanwhile, Dinesh D'Souza — an actual convicted criminal — gets a pardon from Trump.

Trump on pardoning Dinesh D'Souza: "What should have been a minor fine, *like everybody else with election stuff*…what they did to him was horrible.”

Trump, who also may have violated campaign finance laws, thinks he should just have to pay a minor fine if charged.

-Called African nations "shithole countries"
-Said he grabs women by the pussy
-Was in two porn tapes
-Called NFL players "sons of bitches" https://t.co/SkTURkmWQ3
When you hear Dinesh D'Souza referred to as an intellectual, bear in mind he considered Obama using a selfie-stick "unpresidential" but has never found fault in Donald Trump's words or actions.
Continuing the theme, after pardoning Dinesh D’Souza, Trump is now considering a commutation of sentence for former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich as well as a pardon for Martha Stewart.  Trump wants to tell everyone that it’s OK to cheat if it helps his own cause!
If Trump gives a pardon to Dinesh D’Souza, he should be impeached for abusing his power. He should be impeached for thousands of other things too. Retweet if you think it’s time to #ImpeachTrump. This circus is out of control. In November, Republicans will pay at the polls. 🌊

Dinesh D’Souza is what happens when you call conservatives Nazis enough that they start defending Nazis and then calling everyone else a Nazi and it’s definitely your fault also Hillary Clinton’s.
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"
https://t.co/YqI4oO2L5r
More detail via pool from Trump discussing Dinesh D'Souza pardon: "Only because, only because of I felt from I don’t know him, I never met him, I called him last night first time I’ve ever spoken to him I said I’m pardoning you. Nobody asked me to do it.”

👉 Dinesh D’Souza - Campaign finance violations

👉 Joe Arpaio - Civil rights violations

👉 Scooter Libby - Perjury
President Trump pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a right-wing commentator who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations.

What this whole Dinesh D’Souza thing shows us is that the tax cuts generated no additional economic growth, and were basically a giveaway to the wealthiest corporations in human history.
If Trump gives a pardon to Dinesh D’Souza, he should be impeached for abusing his power. He should be impeached for thousands of other things too. Retweet if you think it’s time to #ImpeachTrump. This circus is out of control. In November, Republicans will pay at the polls. 🌊

There are few more prominent political figures who are as virulently racist as Dinesh D’Souza and Joe Arpaio - and Trump has pardoned them both.
Dinesh D’Souza asked friends to contribute to a GOP campaign and then reimbursed them.

“I knew that causing a campaign contribution to be made in the name of another was wrong and something the law forbids,” he said.

He wasn't treated unfairly. He broke the law. And he knew it.

Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
@benshapiro @iamsambee Oh relax. You guys just got Dinesh D'souza back. You'll be back winning the race bating, double standard game again in no time.

To be clear who Dinesh D’Souza is....he pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. He sends out heinously racist, anti-Semitic messaging. He peddles conspiracy theories. He has literally made fun of teenage school shooting survivors. This adulterer is getting a pardon.

“No, but I trust Trump’s judgment on pardoning Dinesh D’Souza because I’m sure he dug into the case and has a sophisticated understanding of justice, the rule of law, and clemency.”

*aide whispers in my ear*

“Oh, he just saw him on TV a lot? Well that makes more sense.”
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.
The reality show with Dinesh D'souza, Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich is going to be lit af.

Thinks it is wrong for women to want to be equal to men

Is against same-sex marriage

Mocked the Stoneman Douglas students

But Ted Cruz thinks he's a "powerful voice for freedom".

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋

Of course Trump pardoned D'Souza. Read what D'Souza's been saying. Think about what Trump's been saying. And remember that triggering the libs is the part of governance Trump is most passionate about.

Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D’Souza a full pardon.

Their selective outrage is pathetic.

Not a word when....

-Rosie O’Donnell just broke the same law.

-Obama pardoned traitors like Bradley Manning.

-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.

@realDonaldTrump Reminder felon Dinesh D'Souza was convicted of federal election fraud after he PLEAD Guilty. That means Dinesh admitted he committed a crime but to Trump GOPers who commit crimes are above the law: https://t.co/hUgIYD4TL6
Obama gave clemency to 1324 people...so leftie frauds shut the hell up about Dinesh D’Souza # justsayin

The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico
Right-wing media praise, justify Trump's decision to pardon Dinesh D'Souza https://t.co/RlDyxAQ97h
Ted Cruz said Dinesh D'Souza was the subject of political prosecution by Obama

Was he?
Dinesh D’Souza is another example of how the Obama Admin abused their power for political gain.

Most corrupt Administration ever.
dinesh d’souza proves you can be a deeply insane grifter who tries to sell depleted uranium to a couple of teens in a trench coat and as long as you go on national television and say that president grandpa has a massive hog everything will work out
The Obama Administration sent Dinesh D'Souza to jail for a $10,000 political campaign contribution

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it
obama pardoned people who faced real injustice. trump pardons pieces of shit like dinesh d'souza and joe arpaio. that's the difference.
Imagine if Ted Nugent, Roseanne, Dinesh D'Souza, and Ann Coulter all met at the White House to protest Samantha Bee calling Ivanka trump a Feckless c*nt.

The planet would shatter from the laughter at hypocrisy.
Refugee parents who are following asylum law to the letter are having their children kidnapped and held for ransom by our government.

Meanwhile, Dinesh D'Souza — an actual convicted criminal — gets a pardon from Trump.

There is no rule of law in this country.
Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D’Souza a full pardon.

Their selective outrage is pathetic.

Not a word when....

-Rosie O’Donnell just broke the same law.

-Obama pardoned traitors like Bradley Manning.

-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.

Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.

To be clear who Dinesh D’Souza is....he pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. He sends out heinously racist, anti-Semitic messaging. He peddles conspiracy theories. He has literally made fun of teenage school shooting survivors. This adulterer is getting a pardon.

Dinesh D'Souza on pardon: "I'm very relieved to have my record clean in a way that fully restores my faith in America, my American dream ... Something that’s hanging over you and you have the United States of America versus Dinesh D’Souza, and that is now gone."
Dinesh D’Souza is an awful person. Today is a good reminder that there will be so much more unfairness before this is over. We’re not ready for it.

After the Dinesh D'Souza pardon, Trump has pardoned people who:

- Obstructed Justice
- Outed Sources
- Committed Election Finance Violations

Meanwhile he's being investigated for the same exact crimes. 

If this isn't evidence of witness tampering, I have no clue what is.

Dinesh D'Souza was given due process. A judge convicted him of fraud, election law and campaign finance law violations, based on the overwhelming evidence.

The pardon of Dinesh D'Souza by Trump is meant to send a message to Michael Cohen not to flip on him.

Unfortunately for Trump, Cohen appears to have broken many NY State laws, and will most likely be charged with State crimes, which are NOT pardonable by the President!
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged

In pardoning the well-documented criminality of folks like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, President Trump is sending a clear message: Personal loyalty to his administration will secure legal immunity.

It can't be overstated how subversive this is to a functioning democracy. https://t.co/oqxuei9pIa
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
@1Romans58 @POTUS @DineshDSouza Soon-to-be "the late Peter Schweizer" and "the late Dinesh D'Souza"? God forbid, but it is possible. Both should have their own security. [Yes, with firearms.]
Dinesh D’Souza is also an accused domestic batterer btw
Imagine getting dumped by Dinesh D’souza, becoming a successful TV/Radio host, and then still choosing to let him spew this self serving excrement on your show. That’s Laura Ingraham https://t.co/ELA6K9gZRQ
Donald Trump has now pardoned Joe Arpaio, Scooter Libby and Dinesh D’Souza
To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"
Today’s #pardons show a system w’o process used largely for political purposes. It will make defending the pardon power more questionable going forward. And it undermines #DOJ &amp; federal prosecutors. Trump Says He Will Pardon Commentator Dinesh D’Souza https://t.co/mrREIvW4dn
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.
Hat’s off to the president, who’s going to pardon Dinesh D’Souza. His prosecution and imprisonment by a hack Democrat prosecutor was outrageous. And there aren’t many GOP presidents who’d have the guts to do this, either. https://t.co/G234MDXzn0
one particularly odious comment i forgot: after unarmed African-American teenager Trayvon Martin was shot to death in Florida, Dinesh D'Souza referred to President Obama as "Grown-Up Trayvon in the White House" https://t.co/BXiuija7zB

BREAKING NEWS: President @realDonaldTrump announced Thursday he will pardon conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who was convicted of making an illegal campaign contribution in 2012. https://t.co/cYX48PX5JH
Obama and his cronies did everything they could to destroy Dinesh D'Souza.

They Failed.

Now President Trump is doing everything he can to restore peace for @DineshDSouza.
To be clear who Dinesh D’Souza is....he pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. He sends out heinously racist, anti-Semitic messaging. He peddles conspiracy theories. He has literally made fun of teenage school shooting survivors. This adulterer is getting a pardon.
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.

If Trump gives a pardon to Dinesh D’Souza, he should be impeached for abusing his power. He should be impeached for thousands of other things too. Retweet if you think it’s time to #ImpeachTrump. This circus is out of control. In November, Republicans will pay at the polls. 🌊

https://t.co/UxPvW9maSS
lol remember when Dinesh D’Souza said the 9/11 terrorists were brave warriors 

and then kicked and beat his wife so badly that she is still suffering from her injuries 

and then committed campaign finance fraud and is now a convicted felon? https://t.co/wT6gfUiBI6
In light of Trump's pardon of Dinesh D'Souza, reposting:

"Trump views law enforcement as merely an instrument of his political will, to be turned loose on his opponents at his whim and weaponized against itself when it tries to hold him accountable." 

https://t.co/BHRgyIpxFC
To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.

President Trump announced that he will give a "full pardon" to Dinesh D'Souza. https://t.co/t8kbFzKUls
Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D’Souza a full pardon.

Their selective outrage is pathetic.

Not a word when....

-Rosie O’Donnell just broke the same law.

-Obama pardoned traitors like Bradley Manning.

-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.
Dinesh D'Souza:
Said of Barrack Obama "you can take the boy out of the ghetto"
Called Michelle Obama "affirmative action" Princeton student
Said slavery wasn't racist, slaves were treated "pretty well"
Minimized Rosa Parks' legacy 
Mocked the Parkland school shooting survivors
Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of one of the crimes Michael Cohen is under investigation for, campaign finance fraud. Impossible to view this as anything other than a “stay strong“ message from Trump to Cohen, especially given the timing. https://t.co/rtjNnF73wy

Donald Trump’s pardon of Dinesh D'Souza sends two strong signals. After Roseanne, he’s making it clear he still supports racist conspiracy theorists who share his views. He’s also trying to communicate to crooks like Cohen, Flynn &amp; Manafort that there’s no reason to flip on him.

Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has committed more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.
If Trump gives a pardon to Dinesh D’Souza, he should be impeached for abusing his power. He should be impeached for thousands of other things too. Retweet if you think it’s time to #ImpeachTrump. This circus is out of control. In November, Republicans will pay at the polls. 🌊

Trump says that Dinesh D’Souza “was treated very unfairly.” 

Do you know who else is treated unfairly.  The thousands of children you have torn away from immigrant parents who were trying to bring their children here for a better life and nothing else.

What about them?
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.

Oh look: the man the president pardoned and who Ted Cruz just praised, fomenting the same vile anti-semitic lie that Roseanne was tweeting. What a coincidence! 

https://t.co/kASRrtWwtM
So Trump will pardon Dinesh D'Souza &amp; says he was “treated very unfairly by our government!” So being found guilty for a crime he pled guilty for constitutes mistreatment? I think he’s just that desperate to have one more voter on his side for the next election!
Dinesh D'Souza has long been a nasty and extreme ideologue peddling hate and racism. So he's a perfect recipient of Trump pardon.

To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋
Dinesh D'Souza was targeted because of his success in exposing Obama as the fraud he is through his hit Movie Obama's America. This was a political hit job. If y think his charges had anything to do with exceeding campaign donation you are very naive
Oh look: the man the president pardoned and who Ted Cruz just praised, fomenting the same vile anti-semitic lie that Roseanne was tweeting. What a coincidence!

Trump's Pardons: 

Joe Arpaio (criminal contempt)

Kristian Mark Saucier (taking photos of classified area on US submarine)

Scooter Libby (perjury and obstruction of justice) 
 
Jack Johnson (convicted of dating a white woman) 

Dinesh D'Souza (illegal campaign contribution)
Dinesh D'Souza More of Trump's Best People. https://t.co/A2YiAtQAMU
To be clear who Dinesh D’Souza is....he pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. He sends out heinously racist, anti-Semitic messaging. He peddles conspiracy theories. He has literally made fun of teenage school shooting survivors. This adulterer is getting a pardon.
Donald Trump’s pardon of Dinesh D'Souza sends two strong signals. After Roseanne, he’s making it clear he still supports racist conspiracy theorists who share his views. He’s also trying to communicate to crooks like Cohen, Flynn &amp; Manafort that there’s no reason to flip on him.
The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico
1. Trump’s entire presidency has been an exercise in the abuse of power. From his personal attacks on patriotic career civil servants like Sally Yates to his pardon is useless propagandists like Dinesh D’Souza, from his nepotism to his pay-for-play with corporations and autocrats
Democrats seem pretty upset that Trump is pardoning Dinesh D'Souza!

If you are mad about this, but said nothing when Rosie O’Donnell broke the same law and NOTHING happened, you are a hypocrite.
Kim Kardashian: "Can you pardon a black grandmother?"
Trump: "No, but I can pardon a brown grand wizard."

@chrislhayes The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"
Not that it affects the legal case, but Dinesh D’Souza’s twitter feed looks like Roseanne’s x 1,000 and is what he’s been known for in recent years. There’s a separate message getting sent there too with this pardon. https://t.co/aDKjkqYiXT

Dinesh D'Souza proves what dad always taught us - "Don't grow up to be a lying, bigoted, crypto-fascist criminal because if you do a lying, bigoted, crypto-fascist criminal might pardon you as a signal to his already indicted henchmen."

-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.
@jonlovett “No American in the country’s history has been locked up for doing what I did,” D’Souza said. “This is typically handled not even as a criminal matter but as a civil matter by the SEC. It was highly unusual for the government to prosecute in this way.” https://t.co/pWMCG759Go
Samantha Bee apologized.
Dinesh D'Souza has never apologized for MANY abhorrent statements.

Is that really someone deserving a presidential pardon?

Trump’s Dinesh D’Souza pardon today, on top of his pardons of Scooter Libby and Joe Arpaio, make sense only as an elephant-whistle to Michael Cohen &amp; all who know damning things about Trump: protect me &amp; I’ll have your back. Turn on me &amp; your goose is cooked. More obstruction!

1) So, with the Dinesh D'Souza @DineshDSouza pardon trending, I've got a wild hair up my ass and want to see what all Obama pardoned people for.
Two days ago, Trump said he was too busy to think about the Russia investigation anymore. Yesterday he met with Kim Kardashian. Today he focused on the urgent business of pardoning Dinesh D'Souza.

Dinesh D’Souza is another example of how the Obama Admin abused their power for political gain.

Most corrupt Administration ever.
After the Dinesh D'Souza pardon, Trump has pardoned people who:

- Obstructed Justice
- Outed Sources
- Committed Election Finance Violations

Meanwhile he's being investigated for the same exact crimes. 

If this isn't evidence of witness tampering, I have no clue what is.

.@POTUS to Give 'Full Pardon' to Dinesh D'Souza: 'He Was Treated Very Unfairly' https://t.co/ieXJgZ5KP8
The orange turd is letting all the CRIMINALS back on the street. WTF!?!
Trump weighs leniency for Martha Stewart and Blagojevich, will pardon conservative Dinesh D'Souza https://t.co/FlsJGie6mS
The left is attacking Trump for pardoning Dinesh D'Souza when all he did was give $20,000 to his friend who was running for office.  Meanwhile Terrorist dictatorships Saudi Arabia/Qatar gave MILLIONS to the Clintons and nobody went to prison. This pardon is the right thing to do.
The people Trump wants to pardon are guilty of the types of crimes Trump fears most.

👉 Dinesh D’Souza - Campaign finance violations
👉 Rod Blagojevich - Political corruption
👉 Joe Arpaio - Civil rights violations
👉 Martha Stewart - Insider trading
👉 Scooter Libby - Perjury
Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of one of the crimes Michael Cohen is under investigation for, campaign finance fraud. Impossible to view this as anything other than a “stay strong“ message from Trump to Cohen, especially given the timing. https://t.co/rtjNnF73wy
In pardoning the well-documented criminality of folks like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, President Trump is sending a clear message: Personal loyalty to his administration will secure legal immunity.

It can't be overstated how subversive this is to a functioning democracy. https://t.co/oqxuei9pIa
Kim Kardashian went to the White House to discuss prison reform and now Trump is pardoning the most corrupt, white collar criminals like Dinesh D’Souza and soon perhaps Rod Blagojevich and Martha Stewart. Meanwhile, Alice Marie Johnson is still languishing in prison.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
I think I speak for all sane Indian Americans in saying we do not claim Dinesh D’Souza.

@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara You got pardoned, but you still have to live your life as Dinesh D'Souza. You will never get rid of that horrible stink.
Dinesh D'Souza is a blatant racist. Cruz has been defending him for years. He was featured in D'Souza's "documentary," a conspiracy theory-ladened pile of --. Journos like @EricaGrieder need to rethink their attitude that Cruz respects the rule of law. He does not. He's corrupt.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
Holy crap. President Donald Trump just pardoned Dinesh D’Souza. Dinesh was targeted by Obama and his lackeys because Dinesh exposed him. They jailed him for political differences, definition of abuse of power.

We are so damn blessed to have Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
Dinesh D'Souza has long been a nasty and extreme ideologue peddling hate and racism. So he's a perfect recipient of Trump pardon. 
https://t.co/Phadw2PNBr
Not that it affects the legal case, but Dinesh D’Souza’s twitter feed looks like Roseanne’s x 1,000 and is what he’s been known for in recent years. There’s a separate message getting sent there too with this pardon. https://t.co/aDKjkqYiXT
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
The erosion of the rule of law continues: Trump pardons Dinesh D'Souza -- and hints of more celebrity pardons

1) So, with the Dinesh D'Souza @DineshDSouza pardon trending, I've got a wild hair up my ass and want to see what all Obama pardoned people for.
After hearing the news of Dinesh D’Souza getting a pardon, it only makes me think who would’ve received a pardon by Hillary?

Bill Cosby?
Harvey Weinstein?
Anthony Weiner?
OJ Simpson?
Suge Knight?
Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.

When you hear Dinesh D'Souza referred to as an intellectual, bear in mind he considered Obama using a selfie-stick "unpresidential" but has never found fault in Donald Trump's words or actions.

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it

Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D’Souza a full pardon.

Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
"D'Souza pleaded guilty in 2014 to reimbursing two of his associates after directing them to contribute $10,000 each to the 2012 Senate campaign of Wendy Long. He also admitted that he knew what he was doing violated the law."

Dinesh D'Souza will be pardoned by Trump. Meanwhile, our prisons are filled with black folks whose only crime was smoking a joint. 

American justice on full display.
Dinesh D’Souza is an awful person. Today is a good reminder that there will be so much more unfairness before this is over. We’re not ready for it.
BREAKING: President Trump will pardon @DineshDSouza, another convicted criminal and political ally.

If Trump pardons you, it is MORE EVIDENCE OF YOUR GUILT.

CONVICTED CRIMINALS:

- Scooter Libby
- Joe Arpaio
- Dinesh D’Souza

The staggering corruption of Dinesh D’Souza’s pardon https://t.co/HlZB5k9NU5
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

Trump pardons Dinesh D'Souza, says lifestyle maven Stewart may be next https://t.co/D8UO1AiN0b
Holy crap. President Donald Trump just pardoned Dinesh D’Souza. Dinesh was targeted by Obama and his lackeys because Dinesh exposed him. They jailed him for political differences, definition of abuse of power.

We are so damn blessed to have Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
2) Documents: Federal Prosecutors Misled Judge in Pursuit of Prison Time For Dinesh D'Souza https://t.co/0mv8uDB3ge
Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.
“KARMA IS A BITCH DEPT: @PreetBharara wanted to destroy a fellow Indian American to advance his career. Then he got fired &amp; I got pardoned.” –Dinesh D’Souza https://t.co/zgHXfo8aCJ
Obama and his cronies did everything they could to destroy Dinesh D'Souza.

They Failed.

Now President Trump is doing everything he can to restore peace for @DineshDSouza.
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged

Rosie O’Donnell did far worse than what Dinesh D’Souza did.

Rosie knowingly committed 5 campaign finance violations and hasn’t faced an ounce of backlash from the left.

End this double standard.

Dinesh D'Souza, guilty of violating campaign law, funneling cash to a GOP campaign

Trump pardoned him because he was "treated unfairly by our government"

No, he did something illegal and was caught.

This is the definition of abuse of power!

In light of Trump's pardon of Dinesh D'Souza, reposting:

Scooter Libby—Perjury

Dinesh D’Souza—Election law violations

Trump is reportedly considering pardoning/commuting sentence for:

Martha Stewart—Obstruction of justice

Rod Blagojevich—Corruption

@realDonaldTrump’s message is clear.
In pardoning the well-documented criminality of folks like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, President Trump is sending a clear message: Personal loyalty to his administration will secure legal immunity.

It can't be overstated how subversive this is to a functioning democracy. https://t.co/oqxuei9pIa

He *claimed* it, but a judge found *no evidence* there was , particularly since Mr D'Souza *failed to present any*.

It was all *made up*.

Called Michelle Obama "affirmative action" Princeton student
Said slavery wasn't racist, slaves were treated "pretty well"
Minimized Rosa Parks' legacy 
Mocked the Parkland school shooting survivors

Trump’s Dinesh D’Souza pardon today, on top of his pardons of Scooter Libby and Joe Arpaio, make sense only as an elephant-whistle to Michael Cohen &amp; all who know damning things about Trump: protect me &amp; I’ll have your back. Turn on me &amp; your goose is cooked. More obstruction!
The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico

Kim Kardashian went to the White House to discuss prison reform and now Trump is pardoning the most corrupt, white collar criminals like Dinesh D’Souza and soon perhaps Rod Blagojevich and Martha Stewart. Meanwhile, Alice Marie Johnson is still languishing in prison.
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.

Trump on pardoning Dinesh D'Souza: "What should have been a minor fine, *like everybody else with election stuff*…what they did to him was horrible.”

Trump, who also may have violated campaign finance laws, thinks he should just have to pay a minor fine if charged.

If Trump gives a pardon to Dinesh D’Souza, he should be impeached for abusing his power. He should be impeached for thousands of other things too. Retweet if you think it’s time to #ImpeachTrump. This circus is out of control. In November, Republicans will pay at the polls. 🌊
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.
Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of one of the crimes Michael Cohen is under investigation for, campaign finance fraud. Impossible to view this as anything other than a “stay strong“ message from Trump to Cohen, especially given the timing. https://t.co/rtjNnF73wy

Obama and his cronies did everything they could to destroy Dinesh D'Souza.

They Failed.

Now President Trump is doing everything he can to restore peace for @DineshDSouza.
Dinesh D’Souza asked friends to contribute to a GOP campaign and then reimbursed them.

“I knew that causing a campaign contribution to be made in the name of another was wrong and something the law forbids,” he said.

He wasn't treated unfairly. He broke the law. And he knew it.
The Obama Administration sent Dinesh D'Souza to jail for a $10,000 political campaign contribution

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it
BREAKING NEWS: Martha Stewart says she will not accept pardon from Trump. Although my prosecution was over-zealous, I can't be party to what this country is becoming.

Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
lol remember when Dinesh D’Souza said the 9/11 terrorists were brave warriors 

and then kicked and beat his wife so badly that she is still suffering from her injuries 

and then committed campaign finance fraud and is now a convicted felon? https://t.co/wT6gfUiBI6

Today Trump has continued to "Drain the Swamp" by pardoning Dinesh D'Souza.  

Because nothing says, "I am removing corruption from politics," like forgiving a man who funneled money through 3rd parties in order to circumvent election laws written to protect our democracy.
“I know Dinesh better than anyone and can attest to his flawed character  and lack of truthfulness,” @DineshDSouza's ex-wife Dixie D'Souza, in a letter for his sentencing. https://t.co/EgtFmu7Qwp
Dinesh D'Souza was screwed over big time!

His pardon wouldn't even make the top 1000 in the controversial pardon list

On the bright side Julian Assange hasn't even committed a crime so it should be easy for the President to help

In light of Trump's pardon of Dinesh D'Souza, reposting:

This is Dinesh D'Souza who pled guilty to campaign finance fraud.  Trump pardoned him to send a message to Cohen and Manafort and others who might flip.

D'Souza is a racist piece of human garbage just like Trump!

This is what D'Souza said about President Barack Obama...👇 https://t.co/63mJcYApOt
1) So, with the Dinesh D'Souza @DineshDSouza pardon trending, I've got a wild hair up my ass and want to see what all Obama pardoned people for.
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"

By pardoning bigots &amp; criminals like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, Donald Trump is sending a clear message to the nation &amp; world: his loyalty resides with those that undermine our nation’s laws &amp; promote hatred at the expense of minorities. In Trump’s America, we don’t matter.
After the Dinesh D'Souza pardon, Trump has pardoned people who:

- Obstructed Justice
- Outed Sources
- Committed Election Finance Violations

Meanwhile he's being investigated for the same exact crimes. 

If this isn't evidence of witness tampering, I have no clue what is.

By pardoning bigots &amp; criminals like Dinesh D'Souza and Joe Arpaio, Donald Trump is sending a clear message to the nation &amp; world: his loyalty resides with those that undermine our nation’s laws &amp; promote hatred at the expense of minorities. In Trump’s America, we don’t matter.
Dinesh D’Souza asked friends to contribute to a GOP campaign and then reimbursed them.

“I knew that causing a campaign contribution to be made in the name of another was wrong and something the law forbids,” he said.

He wasn't treated unfairly. He broke the law. And he knew it.
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, great case against Dinesh D'Souza.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of one of the crimes Michael Cohen is under investigation for, campaign finance fraud. Impossible to view this as anything other than a “stay strong“ message from Trump to Cohen, especially given the timing. https://t.co/rtjNnF73wy
@RichLowry @charlescwcooke @NRO @JonahNRO @jackfowler @jaynordlinger Donald Trump is pardoning Dinesh D'Souza today.

Scroll up for background on D'Souza's history of racism and conspiracy-mongering. https://t.co/rB1zyXYLHN
Here's the real reason Donald Trump pardoned Dinesh D'Souza

https://t.co/m43ob1zBLk https://t.co/jEN5EAohnV
Trump’s Dinesh D’Souza pardon today, on top of his pardons of Scooter Libby and Joe Arpaio, make sense only as an elephant-whistle to Michael Cohen &amp; all who know damning things about Trump: protect me &amp; I’ll have your back. Turn on me &amp; your goose is cooked. More obstruction!
This is Dinesh D'Souza who pled guilty to campaign finance fraud.  Trump pardoned him to send a message to Cohen and Manafort and others who might flip.

D'Souza is a racist piece of human garbage just like Trump!

This is what D'Souza said about President Barack Obama...👇 https://t.co/63mJcYApOt
My god, Trump’s hatred of America’s first black president is bottomless. Pardoning the conspiracy mongering, Obama hating Dinesh D’Souza is yet another sign Trump will do anything to express his virulent hostility.
Democrats seem pretty upset that Trump is pardoning Dinesh D'Souza!

If you are mad about this, but said nothing when Rosie O’Donnell broke the same law and NOTHING happened, you are a hypocrite.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.
Imagine getting dumped by Dinesh D’souza, becoming a successful TV/Radio host, and then still choosing to let him spew this self serving excrement on your show. That’s Laura Ingraham https://t.co/ELA6K9gZRQ

D'Souza admitted to donating tens of thousands of dollars to a U.S. Senate campaign, well above the individual contributions limit of $5,000, by funneling money to other people and donating in their names. https://t.co/tkgHCFuiTK
I love our president! 

He is unraveling every shitty thing Obama ever did! 

In less than 2 years!!!!!! 

Amazing! 

Happy Thursday! 

😊😊😊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😂😂😂😂Trump says he will pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza
Why is Trump pardoning Dinesh D'Souza? Because D'Souza committed campaign finance crimes and Trump knows that shit is right around the corner for his crew. He wants us warmed up to the idea that campaign finance crimes are no big deal. Pardonable. Trump is transparently corrupt.
Dinesh D'Souza has said slavery "wasn't that bad" and defended Hitler.

Is that really someone deserving a presidential pardon?
First Scooter Libby, now Dinesh D’Souza. Maybe Trump is trying to assemble his own racist suicide squad.
Hat’s off to the president, who’s going to pardon Dinesh D’Souza. His prosecution and imprisonment by a hack Democrat prosecutor was outrageous. And there aren’t many GOP presidents who’d have the guts to do this, either. https://t.co/G234MDXzn0
Holy crap. President Donald Trump just pardoned Dinesh D’Souza. Dinesh was targeted by Obama and his lackeys because Dinesh exposed him. They jailed him for political differences, definition of abuse of power.

We are so damn blessed to have Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
Obama and his cronies did everything they could to destroy Dinesh D'Souza.

They Failed.

Now President Trump is doing everything he can to restore peace for @DineshDSouza.
To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋

The Obama Administration sent Dinesh D'Souza to jail for a $10,000 political campaign contribution

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it
Trump's pardons now include:

-Scooter Libby
-Joe Arpaio
-Dinesh D'Souza
A common thread for Joe Arpaio/Scooter Libby/Dinesh D'Souza/Blago/Martha Stewart: supporters of all those people maintained throughout their respective trials that they were being unfairly targeted for various personal or political reasons.
Hmmmm Brian, 
let's get this straight. Rosie O'Donnell PURPOSELY used various names &amp; addresses to commit FRAUD, breaking campaign finance laws &amp; NOTHING happened to her, but Dinesh D'Souza had to pay deeply &amp; was convicted!

Continuing the theme, after pardoning Dinesh D’Souza, Trump is now considering a commutation of sentence for former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich as well as a pardon for Martha Stewart.  Trump wants to tell everyone that it’s OK to cheat if it helps his own cause!

Kim Kardashian went to the White House to discuss prison reform and now Trump is pardoning the most corrupt, white collar criminals like Dinesh D’Souza and soon perhaps Rod Blagojevich and Martha Stewart. Meanwhile, Alice Marie Johnson is still languishing in prison.

Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.
Wow! WE FINALLY have a bi-partisan, NON-biased President! 
After pardoning, Patriot Dinesh D'Souza, President Trump has announced that he is considering doing the same for Trump Hater, Martha Stewart &amp; ex Democrat Governor Rod Blagojevich!

To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Since pardoning Dinesh D’Souza, Trump says he’s considering pardoning Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich too.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico
Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.

Trump to give 'full pardon' to Dinesh D'Souza

President Trump announced Thursday he will pardon conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who was convicted of making an illegal campaign contribution in 2012. 

https://t.co/K2n6XE6blg

Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D’Souza a full pardon.

Their selective outrage is pathetic.

Not a word when....

-Rosie O’Donnell just broke the same law.

-Obama pardoned traitors like Bradley Manning.

-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.
D'Souza admitted to donating tens of thousands of dollars to a U.S. Senate campaign, well above the individual contributions limit of $5,000, by funneling money to other people and donating in their names. https://t.co/tkgHCFuiTK
BREAKING! 
President Trump To Grant full pardon to Dinesh D’Souza!! Great decision, well-deserved! Congratulations @DineshDSouza! 
https://t.co/trg1NawH48
3 out of 4 Trump's pardons:

Ex-Sheriff Joe Arpaio - violation of court order
Scooter Libby - lying to federal investigators
Dinesh D'Souza - violating federal election law

Trump is basically pardoning the crimes he and his buddies have been doing.
🤨
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"

Samantha Bee is vulgar?
Here's vulgarity:  Responding to photo of Parkland kids reacting to Florida @GOP voting down assault weapon ban, Dinesh D'Souza tweeted "worst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs" 
Yes, he said that
&amp; yes @realDonaldTrump is pardoning him

1) Dinesh D’Souza’s prosecution could’ve been politically motivated. 2) D’Souza has systematically destroyed his own professional credibility with the vile, unhinged crap he writes/tweets/says. 

Both of these are true. He long ago ceased being any kind of conservative champion.

Trump on pardoning Dinesh D'Souza: "What should have been a minor fine, *like everybody else with election stuff*…what they did to him was horrible.”

Trump, who also may have violated campaign finance laws, thinks he should just have to pay a minor fine if charged.

Thinks it is wrong for women to want to be equal to men

Is against same-sex marriage

Mocked the Stoneman Douglas students

Donald Trump’s pardon of Dinesh D'Souza sends two strong signals. After Roseanne, he’s making it clear he still supports racist conspiracy theorists who share his views. He’s also trying to communicate to crooks like Cohen, Flynn &amp; Manafort that there’s no reason to flip on him.
@DavidCornDC Dinesh D’Souza is a 2nd rate intellect (and I’m being generous here) and a 3rd rate human being...

Continuing the theme, after pardoning Dinesh D’Souza, Trump is now considering a commutation of sentence for former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich as well as a pardon for Martha Stewart.  Trump wants to tell everyone that it’s OK to cheat if it helps his own cause!

and then committed campaign finance fraud and is now a convicted felon? https://t.co/wT6gfUiBI6
The Obama Administration sent Dinesh D'Souza to jail for a $10,000 political campaign contribution

Obama's own campaign took $1.8 million in illegal contributions but no one went to jail for it
The staggering corruption of Dinesh D’Souza’s pardon  https://t.co/SbvUZ5N5xr via @SimonMaloy https://t.co/9RtKc9g8A2
The real reason Donald Trump just pardoned Dinesh D’Souza https://t.co/Ya77krUxNU
Let's be very clear, Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of one of the crimes Michael Cohen is about to be convicted for, federal campaign finance fraud. The message from Trump to Cohen is "Stay quiet, I got your back" , especially while the feds are pouring over mountains of evidence. https://t.co/993wGHszO1
Pardoning fellow conspiracist and bigot Dinesh D’Souza allows @realDonaldTrump to remind his people not to flip and that he’ll pardon them eventually. The bonus is that he gets to do all of that while shitting on the rule of law and minorities all at once. https://t.co/gmx7MbJOfr
Dinesh D'Souza pled guilty to violating campaign law; funneling cash to a GOP campaign.

Trump's pardon doesn't just signal Manafort &amp; others that they'll get one, but foreign regimes that they too can break laws to help Trump.

We didn't serve to see our vote attacked this way.
The left is attacking Trump for pardoning Dinesh D'Souza when all he did was give $20,000 to his friend who was running for office.  Meanwhile Terrorist dictatorships Saudi Arabia/Qatar gave MILLIONS to the Clintons and nobody went to prison. This pardon is the right thing to do.

Hard to overstate just how much of a classy, graceful, honorable, and intellectually honest person Dinesh D’Souza truly is. https://t.co/8MyUGYMHxN
Dinesh D’Souza is an immigrant who has commited more felonies than all of DREAMers combined, but he made illegal campaign contributions to the GOP so, of course, Trump wants to pardon him while ruining the lives of smart, hardworking, millennials brought here by their parents.
When I was at Dartmouth, Dinesh D'Souza's right-wing newspaper outed gays, sledgehammered a shanty town, and harassed black professors.

Everything that is happening in America today by trump was all warned by Hillary Clinton but some of you chose to stay home, vote 3rd party, or voting for trump and calling it a "protest vote"

So I beg you..right your wrong and vote GOP out this Nov

Dinesh D'Souza #impeachment
Trump will pardon conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza.  Thank you Mr. President . This was one more nasty effort by Obama to silence someone who spoke out against him!               #ma4t  https://t.co/Lj8K1vb69y
BREAKING! 
President Trump To Grant full pardon to Dinesh D’Souza!! Great decision, well-deserved! Congratulations @DineshDSouza! 
https://t.co/trg1NawH48
The past year, Dinesh D’Souza has:
—Suggested the Charlottesville rally was staged
—Shared a meme calling Obama a “gay Muslim”
—Suggested Michelle Obama is a man
—Started a conspiracy theory about the Vegas shooting
—Defended Adolf Hitler as "NOT anti-gay"
https://t.co/YqI4oO2L5r
To be clear...

Michael Cohen is currently under multiple investigations, including one for campaign finance fraud.

Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of campaign finance fraud.

Who else sees this as a “stay strong, stick with me“ signal from trump to Cohen? ✋
Holy crap. President Donald Trump just pardoned Dinesh D’Souza. Dinesh was targeted by Obama and his lackeys because Dinesh exposed him. They jailed him for political differences, definition of abuse of power.

We are so damn blessed to have Donald Trump in the Oval Office.

Dinesh D'Souza:

Believes liberals caused 9/11

Thinks it is wrong for women to want to be equal to men

Is against same-sex marriage

Mocked the Stoneman Douglas students

But Ted Cruz thinks he's a "powerful voice for freedom". 

We hate him because he's a POS, Ted, like you. https://t.co/7thPawW8i4
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
DOJ files reveal political affiliation played role in prosecution of Dinesh D'Souza by the office of @PreetBharara.
Dinesh D’Souza was convicted of one of the crimes Michael Cohen is under investigation for, campaign finance fraud. Impossible to view this as anything other than a “stay strong“ message from Trump to Cohen, especially given the timing. https://t.co/rtjNnF73wy

On Laura Ingraham's radio show, Dinesh D'Souza said his weekly court-mandated community service took a toll on him: "That’s very difficult to do if you’re trying to have a productive life or hold down a normal job."
BREAKING: President Trump will pardon @DineshDSouza, another convicted criminal and political ally.

If Trump pardons you, it is MORE EVIDENCE OF YOUR GUILT.

CONVICTED CRIMINALS:

- Scooter Libby
- Joe Arpaio
- Dinesh D’Souza

RT to spread the truth!
To be clear who Dinesh D’Souza is....he pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. He sends out heinously racist, anti-Semitic messaging. He peddles conspiracy theories. He has literally made fun of teenage school shooting survivors. This adulterer is getting a pardon.

Dinesh D’Souza said the Charlottesville rally was a hoax, shared images calling Obama a gay Muslim, said Michelle Obama is a man, started conspiracy theory about Vegas shooting, mocked shooting survivors and defended Hitler. Just in the past year. This pardon is disgraceful.

Trump’s Dinesh D’Souza pardon today, on top of his pardons of Scooter Libby and Joe Arpaio, make sense only as an elephant-whistle to Michael Cohen &amp; all who know damning things about Trump: protect me &amp; I’ll have your back. Turn on me &amp; your goose is cooked. More obstruction!
The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct &amp; the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period. https://t.co/bA3I8vs4QQ via @politico

Hopefully, Dinesh D'souza can now go back to doing what he does best: being president of a "college" that was located inside the Empire State Building.
In addition to being a racist troll, Dinesh D'Souza is also an adulterer and vicious little wife-beater - no wonder Mango Mussolini feels such a kinship 🙄https://t.co/5u0yuuvwgT https://t.co/yxhDMae8we

Wow, is this Kim K's prison reform at work?

Trump offers pardon to conservative pundit Dinesh D’Souza, suggests others could be coming
https://t.co/z7Vj46yZFB
A common thread for Joe Arpaio/Scooter Libby/Dinesh D'Souza/Blago/Martha Stewart: supporters of all those people maintained throughout their respective trials that they were being unfairly targeted for various personal or political reasons.
one particularly odious comment i forgot: after unarmed African-American teenager Trayvon Martin was shot to death in Florida, Dinesh D'Souza referred to President Obama as "Grown-Up Trayvon in the White House" https://t.co/BXiuija7zB
So I assume Dinesh D’Souza will start advocating for criminal justice reform in earnest? https://t.co/IWBQjUFgVE
Dinesh D’Souza is an awful person. Today is a good reminder that there will be so much more unfairness before this is over. We’re not ready for it.

@realDonaldTrump Conservative activist Dinesh D’Souza faced political persecution after he directed and released anti-Obama film, “2016: Obama’s America”. He was indicted over illegal campaign contributions.

It was an obvious witch hunt.
