When will Republicans understand that a "Great Depression" is exactly what Trump and Putin wants?   Trump can buy up thousands of properties cheap when America's economy collapses.  His transformation to top American oligarch will then be complete.

If America rebounded from...
The Great Depression
World War II
McCarthyism
Assassinations of Medgar, Malcolm, MLK, JFK &amp; RFK
Vietnam
Nixon
Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld
9/11...
Then America can rebound from trump &amp; Fox "News" too...I hope. 🙄

Normally I would agree, You're correct in saying the RW is paranoid, that's why they peddle in conspiracies..However, add these tariffs to the $1.5 trillion debt from trump/GOP #taxscam, depressed wages, inflation &amp; bank deregulation..a "Great Depression" is quite possible. #Vote https://t.co/dlu4R4kD18
