@NeilAnAlien Pres Trump issued three anti federal collective bargaining Exec Orders Friday, so we're pushing this #EOhellNO hashtag today if you would join in, brother!!
The President treats federal employees much like Putin would, but , as Nelson Rockefeller said at 1964 #RNC, "this is still a free country, ladies and gentlemen. " #EOhellNO  @SenJohnMcCain @JohnKasich @repgregwalden @SenatorDole https://t.co/8j3EMQZZtH
Labor unions empower everyday people to improve their work environments and negotiate fair wages for all workers. #EOhellNO

A large number of vets work at the VA and are federal employees and union members. Many times it’s the only job that will hire people with military disabilities like PTSD and TBI. Now we are being attacked for supporting and joining unions and called bad employees  #EOhellNO
We stand with @AFGENational and unions nationwide as they fight the Trump administration's toxic, anti-worker agenda. #EOhellNO

Federal workers outraged at suggestion they might have to be accountable for their work like the rest of America. #EOhellNO

P.S. EOs are literally opposite of "anti-democratic" - give elected officials (accountable to voters) more supervisory power over unelected bureaucrats.

-@AFGENational, which represents @EPA workers &amp; other Fed workers, is suing the Trump Admin over their anti-union executive orders. Under Scott Pruitt's tenure, it's more important than ever that EPA workers have rights at work &amp; a strong voice. #EOhellNO #solidarity
