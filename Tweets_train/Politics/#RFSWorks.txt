Is it too much to ask @EPAScottPruitt to give consumers more choices at the pump? Why are you restricting the sale of E15 year-round? It’s time to move forward with what @realDonaldTrump told you to do on May 8. #IWantE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/Lkhg85IdXX
I think we are all tiring of rising gas prices. (Nationwide avg is $2.96) But there is a fix for this @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt #IWantMyE15 #RFSWorks
With low corn commodity prices, finding uses for corn is imperative. Having E15 year-round helps do that. It also helps Iowa's economy! It’s time to free E15 and make it available to consumers year-round. They deserve E15 every day! #IWantE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/zXWDJwJgXV
E15 unleaded fuel can be used by 90 percent of the cars and light trucks on the road, and it’s cleaner and costs less than any other gasoline cars are using today. @EPAScottPruitt #IWantMyE15 #RFSworks.

Allowing #E15 year-round would help spur demand for farmers who are suffering from low prices and surplus crops. @EPAScottPruitt, this is a lost opportunity to do something to help Americans. #IWantMyE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/yvmY4GOlok

Why is September 16, 2018 such an important date for ethanol retailers? @blendor explains via @EthanolMagazine https://t.co/Z9xx6XcOJd #IWantE15 #RFSWorks

Today E-15 is unable to be sold until September 15th. Ethanol is safe and approved for all 2001 and newer cars, trucks and SUV's. It is also the lowest-cost fuel available for 2001 cars and new being generally 40 cents cheaper than conventional gasoline. #RFSWorks https://t.co/dic7MwIn7c

@realDonaldTrump Black Tape where the E15 Button used to be , lady customer “so the EPA is making me spend more for my gas?” #RFSWorks @ACEethanol @iowafuel @EthanolRFA @ssovprincipal https://t.co/QzlCNDLzgZ
We need it now – higher blends of ethanol, like E-15 year-round! It is time to set it free and do what’s right by offering consumers more choices and cheaper prices at the pump. #IwantMyE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/kcG6pvTAHi
@realDonaldTrump has promised on more than one occasion to allow E15 use year-round but @EPAScottPruitt has so far refused to make good on that promise. Rural America is hurting and deserves immediate action. #IWantMyE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/wd43bNyudd
Environmentally Friendly. Consumer Choice. Savings at the pump. E15 Every Day. #IWantE15 #RFSWorks. https://t.co/uQgYRn2iI8
Thanks @SecretarySonny for your support by knowing the importance of selling E15 year-round and its impact on America's corn farmers! #IWantMyE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/AlIEOByazw
Fuel retailers across the U.S. offer #E15 -- why stifle American businesses with unnecessary regulation? @realDonaldTrump, year-round E15 is good business! #IWantMyE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/SFxYk6CM9b
@EPAScottPruitt what’s the hold up? @realDonaldTrump told you 50 days ago to allow E15 year round. Instead, EPA is handing out Millions of dollars in exemptions to refiners like Holly Frontier. #Seriously?! Consumers want cleaner air &amp; a choice at the pump! #RFSworks https://t.co/lr2VuB9So1

It’s summer driving season and gas prices are surging. If @EPAScottPruitt would follow through with @realDonaldTrump’s directive to allow E15 to be sold year-round, consumers would save on average 3-10 cents per gallon. That adds up! #IWantMyE15 #RFSWorks https://t.co/RMkZcccIOp
