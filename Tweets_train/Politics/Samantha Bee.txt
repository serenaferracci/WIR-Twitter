Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a "Feckless C**t" and made fun of a student with cancer because of his hair.

Yet the liberal media is awarding her for "advancing social change" 

Give me a break.
Ivanka Trump is feckless. The other word Samantha Bee used is not one I would use about a woman, but I'm not a woman, so yeah, the rules are different. And everything else about this is a bunch of right-wing assholes who care nothing about women pretending they do. So...nope.
Imagine being more aggrieved this morning over Samantha Bee speaking truth to power than Trump openly abusing his executive powers to issue yet another pardon out of political convenience.
Sorry, poorly educated...NOTHING will happen to Samantha Bee because she DID NOT disparage Ivanka's race or heritage. She used a dirty label to accurately described an unelected charlatan that's undermining our democracy...VERY DIFFERENT from being racist to black people üíØüì©

@chuckwoolery Lest we not forget Samantha Bee for calling Ivanka a "feckless C*nt".  That's pretty classy right?  And no one thinks thats bad? Think again. Imagine if that had been said about MichelleO?  The vitriol spewed @POTUS &amp; family is off the charts by comparison to the OsamaBamas.

So Samantha Bee shattered the glass ceiling of letting people call women the awful c word... we can all do that now, right?
Samantha Bee calling Ivanka the C word is one thing. I would never say it, though I know that‚Äòs not a view shared by all. It‚Äôs not comparable to a long history of bigotry.

Telling Ivanka to wear a tight, low-cut outfit to get her dad in line? Crossing the line. Disgustingly.

Cunts are powerful, beautiful, nurturing and honest.
Compare ABC‚Äôs reaction to Roseanne Barr‚Äôs tweet w TBS‚Äôs non-reaction to Samantha Bee and you‚Äôll see a double-standard in action. There‚Äôs no uprising against Bee. Why? Because she is liberal.  Because the MSM protects Obama and his aides, but not Trump. The hypocrisy is sickening.

If you think Samantha Bee's vulgarity is equivalent to racism then you're either ignorant, maliciously dishonest, or a racist yourself. #GTFOH
Samantha Bee's show airs only once a week and is tightly scripted from beginning to end, so the question right now isn't why she called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c***," but which executives at Turner Broadcasting--which also owns CNN--approved the script.
Samantha, you cant hold a candle to Ivanka. Your irreverence if aimed at a democrat president's daughter would have gotten you fired. 

https://t.co/pfqFw1gOAQ
Samantha Bee is particularly awful.

She has attempted to hide the fact that she is ferociously unfunny with relentless vulgarity and that annoyingly aggressive, sanctimonious, contrived 'right-on' bolshie feminism act.

She has failed.
If a conservative called one of the Obama daughters what Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump, there would be boycotts and riots as far as the eye can see.

This is yet another example of the egregious double standard in our society.

Samantha Bee is a disgrace.

Trump calls out Samantha Bee for calling Ivanka a c***, yet he sees nothing wrong with inviting Ted Nugent to the White House when he's called Hilary a c*** on more than one occasion.

Everyone repeat after me-

HYPOCRITE

Samantha Bee‚Äôs comment was hateful and distasteful, but it wasn‚Äôt racist. If you want to fire her for making hateful comments, then you can‚Äôt defend Trump for doing the exact same thing on a daily basis!
If Roseanne got her show canceled when comparing a black woman to an ape, then I think it‚Äôs only fair that when Samantha Bee called Ivanka the C word, Roseanne gets canceled again.

The difference between Roseanne and Samantha Bee; Roseanne tried to utilize stereotype to attack someone who wasn't doing anything. Samantha Bee uses her platform to request the US stops separating families. You swing up when you can. I pity you if you think it's comparable.

Her comment was pre-written, recorded, &amp; aired exactly the way she intended it to be.

After all, Ivanka is everything Bee is not...

Ivanka is gorgeous, intelligent, eloquent, successful, and influential.

Bitter and jealous feminists like Samantha Bee hate everything Ivanka stands for.
Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a "Feckless C**t" and made fun of a student with cancer because of his hair.

Yet the liberal media is awarding her for "advancing social change" 

Give me a break.
Interesting the White House is outraged over comedian Samantha bee using the C word about Ivanka but they refuse to condemn Roseanne comparing a black woman to an ape.
It's interesting to see Trump folks outraged at Samantha Bee and Sally Field and claiming they are mean elite celebrities. 

Fun facts:
-They support a guy who openly bragged about sexual assault and has called women worse things. 
-Said guy is a celebrity.

Samantha Bee's show airs only once a week and is tightly scripted from beginning to end, so the question right now isn't why she called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c***," but which executives at Turner Broadcasting--which also owns CNN--approved the script.
Roseanne deserved to get fired for her comment. Samantha Bee called Ivanka a ‚Äúc*nt‚Äù on air and Keith Olbermann routinely calls the President a ‚Äúmotherf*cker.‚Äù Do you think either will get fired?

Samantha Bee calling Ivanka a cunt on TV was a signal - it's behavior they want to normalize / encourage - that it's okay to attack and bully right wing women.

Samantha, you cant hold a candle to Ivanka. Your irreverence if aimed at a democrat president's daughter would have gotten you fired. 

https://t.co/pfqFw1gOAQ
I agree. Disgusting low-life Samantha Bee should be fired immediately. https://t.co/7FhjjqllzA
Compare ABC‚Äôs reaction to Roseanne Barr‚Äôs tweet w TBS‚Äôs non-reaction to Samantha Bee and you‚Äôll see a double-standard in action. There‚Äôs no uprising against Bee. Why? Because she is liberal.  Because the MSM protects Obama and his aides, but not Trump. The hypocrisy is sickening.
If a conservative called one of the Obama daughters what Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump, there would be boycotts and riots as far as the eye can see.

This is yet another example of the egregious double standard in our society.

If you think Samantha Bee's vulgarity is equivalent to racism then you're either ignorant, maliciously dishonest, or a racist yourself. #GTFOH
@therealroseanne What you said about Valerie wasn't great but it pales in comparison to what the media and Hollywood have said about Trump and his family. Samantha Bee just referred to Ivanka Trump as a "feckless c**t. But that's okay.
I do NOT approve of Samantha Bee calling Ivanka a c***. 

Ivanka has neither the warmth nor the depth of a c***.
Samantha Bee calling a feckless cunt a feckless cunt isn‚Äôt the same as making racist remarks. Why are republicans so stupid?
@Ruby34569375 @scatteredthings @timingloop @iamsambee Not. The. Same. So stop making false comparatives. 

Samantha Bee used the C-word to disparage someone's abhorrent tone-deaf elitist BEHAVIOR. 

Roseanne used the word APE to disparage someone's RACE and EXISTIENCE.

#stfu #MAGAt
Right-wing America comparing harsh dissent over real issues from Samantha Bee to blatant antisemitism and racism from Roseanne shows that conservatives still don‚Äôt take bigotry seriously enough. Bee could‚Äôve used a less offensive word, but this is an obvious false equivalency.

Samantha Bee used the word she used because a senior White House advisor won't fight against Trump's policy of ripping small children away from their parents at the border. Please proportionalize your outrage accordingly.
Samantha Bee is particularly awful.

She has attempted to hide the fact that she is ferociously unfunny with relentless vulgarity and that annoyingly aggressive, sanctimonious, contrived 'right-on' bolshie feminism act.

She has failed.

Samantha Bee Called Ivanka a Feckless C**t and said do something about your dad separating undocumented families . But did she call Obama daughters that when he deported over 2Million illegal immigrants?
If a conservative called one of the Obama daughters what Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump, there would be boycotts and riots as far as the eye can see.

This is yet another example of the egregious double standard in our society.

Ivanka is gorgeous, intelligent, eloquent, successful, and influential.

Bitter and jealous feminists like Samantha Bee hate everything Ivanka stands for.

No one seems to be talking about Samantha Bee's excellent use of the word "feckless."
Samantha Bee being vulgar isn't even in the same category as Roseanne being racist, and it's not what the world should be focusing on the day that Trump sends an authoritarian "I got you boo" to his cronies by pardoning feckless criminal cunt Dinesh D'Souza

Your government is ripping children- babies and toddlers- out of the arms of their mothers. 648 children were taken from their parents in the first 13 days fo Operation Streamline alone. #WhereAreTheChildren ?

But sure. Let's worry about something Samantha Bee said on TV.
Trump called Sally Yates the same word Samantha Bee used to describe Ivanka. 

The media didn‚Äôt care about that though.

The Samantha Bee and Roseanne controversies are just proving that there‚Äôs a clear double standard and certain people can say whatever they want and get away with it while others get punished for it Either let everyone voice their opinion no matter how bad or take away free speech
The Samantha Bee controversy reminds us that the death count in Puerto Rico is approximately 70 times higher than the government reported, and that the media and Congress absolutely need to look into it more closely.
Q) You know who got Trump elected? 

A) Samantha Bee

That's right, when an (I) is thinking about a party to vote for and they hear someone representing (D) calling a successful woman a "C***" on television, you better believe (R) just picked up votes.

SHAME SHAME ON YOU @iamsambee YOU ARE DISGUSTING! #SamanthaBee https://t.co/AISHQIvAUV
Samantha Bee's show airs only once a week and is tightly scripted from beginning to end, so the question right now isn't why she called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c***," but which executives at Turner Broadcasting--which also owns CNN--approved the script.
Retweet if you want Samantha Bee off the air permanently for her vile and sick comments towards Ivanka Trump. 

I‚Äôm so sick of the double standard and liberals getting away with murder.

I want Samantha Bee to feel the wrath of an upset public.
The problem w/ liberal comics like Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, and Kathy Griffin is that they've replaced laughs with applause... so instead of trying to make people laugh they're just trying to get ppl who agree with them to clap.
Stop with the 'TBS should fire Samantha Bee' crap for calling Ivanka Trump a "C-nt"...

"Anyone who thinks Hillary isn't a c-nt is a pussy."
- Roseanne on Twitter - October 9th, 2016

What happened after that?  Roseanne got her own TV Show.
Samantha Bee Called Ivanka a Feckless C**t and said do something about your dad separating undocumented families . But did she call Obama daughters that when he deported over 2Million illegal immigrants?
The context of Samantha Bee's words toward Ivanka Trump is that families are being torn apart at the border and someone ‚Äì anyone ‚Äì needs to do something about it.

If you're more offended by four letters than by children separated from their parents, you're on the wrong side.
I do NOT approve of Samantha Bee calling Ivanka a c***.

Had a conservative host said this about a Dem President‚Äôs daughter, this would now be Day 2 that he/she was out of a job. You know this is true https://t.co/2gMoFG9K5i

@IvankaTrump What Samantha Bee said about you was beyond appalling. I too have been at the receiving end of one of her jokes/insults. She mocked me and called me a Nazi because of my hair style that I had due to radiation for grade 4 glioblastoma.
Samantha Bee may have apologized but Kathy Griffin, Sally Field, other Hollywood liberals standing by her. https://t.co/4A9hnYDfEw
I will never agree with calling someone a c**t. Samantha Bee is wrong for using that slur. I dislike ivanka but a word like that is plain disrespectful.
You know, one can understand that Roseanne‚Äôs racist statement is something entirely different than Samantha Bee‚Äôs vileness and still realize they‚Äôre both wrong. It‚Äôs not a racism ‚Äúcompare and contrast‚Äù.
Kathy Griffin crawled out of her hole today to defend Samantha Bee‚Äôs disgusting ‚Äúfeckless c*nt‚Äù comment directed towards Ivanka Trump.

Two classless losers calling themselves comedians.

Kathy needs to crawl back into her hole &amp; take Samantha with her.
If you think Samantha Bee's vulgarity is equivalent to racism then you're either ignorant, maliciously dishonest, or a racist yourself. #GTFOH
Samantha Bee's show airs only once a week and is tightly scripted from beginning to end, so the question right now isn't why she called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c***," but which executives at Turner Broadcasting--which also owns CNN--approved the script.

Liberal womenlike Samantha Bee are always championing women's rights and equal opportunity........but if you're an attractive, conservative woman, they will stop at nothing to bury you.
Samantha Bee exercised her free speech and TBS decided to continue their free association. Now it‚Äôs on you to either support her or not, boycott TBS or not, or share you own opinion as a free person or not. Once again, freedom is messy but it‚Äôs better than the alternative. https://t.co/kPQcPyhjLf

Our country is under attack by the most insidious and corrupt president and crime family in American history. Samantha Bee calling Ivanka Trump 'feckless c*nt' -- someone who's willingly pocketing millions of dollars from her daddy's dastardly deeds should've been said long ago.
If you are celebrating that Roseanne‚Äôs show was canceled but are not offended by Samantha Bee calling Ivanka Trump a "feckless c**t" you are part of the problem. You can‚Äôt have it both ways.

Our country is under attack by the most insidious and corrupt president and crime family in American history. Samantha Bee calling Ivanka Trump 'feckless c*nt' -- someone who's willingly pocketing millions of dollars from her daddy's dastardly deeds should've been said long ago.

@THEHermanCain @TBSNetwork Samantha Bee... another fine example of an Obama supporter going high when we go low.
TBS' Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c*nt" on her show last night.

So when is she being fired, publicly reprimanded for her abhorrent comments, or having her show cancelled?

Let us know, TBS!
Isnt truth a defense for Samantha Bee?  Roseanne lied &amp; called VJ a gorilla. . .obviously VJ ISNT a gorilla. . .Samantha Bee called @IvankaTrump a feckless cunt. . .truth is a defense, no?
Compare ABC‚Äôs reaction to Roseanne Barr‚Äôs tweet w TBS‚Äôs non-reaction to Samantha Bee and you‚Äôll see a double-standard in action. There‚Äôs no uprising against Bee. Why? Because she is liberal.  Because the MSM protects Obama and his aides, but not Trump. The hypocrisy is sickening.
Pay attention to how the media handles the Samantha Bee story after the Roseanne Barr story.
On the heels of the Roseanne cancellation, people are taking issue with Samantha Bee's Ivanka Trump insult. https://t.co/6t1g8g7FX1
If you think Samantha Bee's vulgarity is equivalent to racism then you're either ignorant, maliciously dishonest, or a racist yourself. #GTFOH
Samantha Bee‚Äôs comment was hateful and distasteful, but it wasn‚Äôt racist. If you want to fire her for making hateful comments, then you can‚Äôt defend Trump for doing the exact same thing on a daily basis!
Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a ‚Äúfeckless c*nt‚Äù and some are defending this? You‚Äôre the problem with Hollywood. What happened to civility? She needs to be fired.
Roseanne is not the same as Samantha Bee. There‚Äôs a significant difference between a woman using vulgar language about another woman and a white person using racist language about a black person. https://t.co/tUdqi8iv6E
Stop with the 'TBS should fire Samantha Bee' crap for calling Ivanka Trump a "C-nt"...

"Anyone who thinks Hillary isn't a c-nt is a pussy."
- Roseanne on Twitter - October 9th, 2016

What happened after that?  Roseanne got her own TV Show.
Public Announcement‚ÄºÔ∏è Where are all the people that attacked Roseanne? 

Samantha Bee - @iamsambee called @IvankaTrump the C- Word and we are waiting on your outrage? 

Her apology is being broadcasted but not @therealroseanne ? 

HELLO IS ANYBODY THERE? https://t.co/kRj7OLLdTy
Waiting for the liberal outrage &amp; firing of Samantha Bee for calling Ivanka Trump a feckless c$nt on air.
He‚Äôs right. Why is Samantha Bee able to get away with this? https://t.co/8V7I6xbWQT

Wow, can‚Äôt believe Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a ‚Äúfeckless cunt.‚Äù A very poor choice of words. I would‚Äôve gone with ‚ÄúFascist cunt.‚Äù
We‚Äôll see how long it takes TBS to fire Samantha Bee &amp; cancel ‚ÄúFull Frontal‚Äù for this unjustified &amp; vile attack on Ivanka. Not holding my breath...Again, the hypocrisy in the liberal media is thick.  https://t.co/seMxspFsy5
Roseanne called someone an ‚Äúape‚Äù and her life is ruined.

Samantha Bee calls Ivanka Trump a ‚Äúfeckless c*nt‚Äù and she gets to keep her show.

Sorry conservatives. The rules apply to you but not Democrats!

#insidepolitics Hey @JohnKingCNN isn't the hypocrisy deplorable?

Oct. 9, 2016. Guess which female comedian called a woman in politics a ‚Äúcunt‚Äù &amp; faced little if any backlash from fans &amp; MSM. Plus given new ABC show.

Hint: It‚Äôs not Samantha Bee. https://t.co/QxW1Hwlfnb
Dear TBS, 

Just curious on when you'll fire Samantha Bee... 

Asking for a friend. 

Signed, 

Forgotten Americans
Wow if you can't understand the difference between what Samantha Bee said and what Roseanne said, you're hopeless.

Let us know, TBS!
Samantha Bee went too far, but...

It wasn't racist

It wasn't mocking a dying American hero

It wasn't a president sexually assaulting 19 women, defrauding contractors for decades, taking bribes and collaborating with our enemies

It was a 'bad' word https://t.co/SLJOowbTN6
Samantha, you cant hold a candle to Ivanka. Your irreverence if aimed at a democrat president's daughter would have gotten you fired.

Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a "Feckless C**t" and made fun of a student with cancer because of his hair.

Yet the liberal media is awarding her for "advancing social change" 

Give me a break.

Hot Take:

Whether you are rosanne barr, or Samantha Bee.  Whether you're a famous celeb or an average joe.  Whether you are on the internet or in real life.

How about we just stop insulting each other on every little thing?

Mutual respect might get us a lot further.
What "Samantha Bee" said is disgusting to its core.  Let's see how consistent the big media is going to be when it comes to doling out punishments for what comedians say about public figures.  This is gonna be interesting.
I like Samantha Bee a lot, but she is flat wrong to call Ivanka a cunt. 

Cunts are powerful, beautiful, nurturing and honest.
Michelle Obama said she was ‚Äúshaken to the core‚Äú by Donald Trump‚Äòs language...
 where was she when Samantha Bee was calling Ivanka Trump the C word.
