Dear @realDonaldTrump: Remember when you went on national TV with Lester Holt &amp; told the American people you fired James Comey because of Russia? There's a tape of it.

Martha Stewart, meanwhile, hits the Trump bingo: a) hosted a The Apprentice spinoff; b) was prosecuted by James Comey; c) was convicted of lying to the FBI and obstruction of justice.
All three real or potential subjects of Trump‚Äôs clemency power were tied to prosecutors who are on the president‚Äôs list of nemeses: D‚ÄôSouza was prosecuted by Bharara, Stewart by Comey and Blagojevich by Comey‚Äôs friend, Fitzgerald.
Americans aren‚Äôt tired of the Mueller investigation. We are tired of hearing Trump talk (mostly lie)
all the time about the Mueller investigation.

Trump, again, denies firing Comey over Russia despite saying exactly that at the time @CNNPolitics https://t.co/8v6fDE3GZZ
Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza a full pardon.

Their selective outrage is pathetic.

Not a word when....

-Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell just broke the same law.

-Obama pardoned traitors like Bradley Manning.

-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.
Trump, 2017: "I fired James Comey because of Russia!"
Trump, 2018: "I never fired James Comey because of Russia!"
New York Times: "Is this a demonstrable falsehood? If only there were some way to tell."

@AriFleischer I wonder what Ari's opinion is of Trump saying THIS to Russians....in the Oval Office....and not alerting U.S. media to fact of the meeting, much less a transcript:

Let's go to the videotape: https://t.co/VXIjcrBSwY
Not only did Trump obviously admit he fired Comey over Russia to Lester Holt, but it was such a disastrous moment for him that he hasn't done a single interview with a non-friendly TV reporter in the more than a year since.

In fact, POTUS is the person who's publicly connected Comey's firing to the Russia investigation.

It's as if Trump is building a squad of convicted felons who'll unite with him to battle the evil villain, Federal Prosecution.

@JohnRMoffitt I‚Äôm afraid Trump will say he fired him because of Hillary and because Comey was making up the ‚ÄúRussia thing‚Äù to justify the witch hunt.  No one is picking that up, but he will use that defense. That‚Äôs where he‚Äôs been heading.

How do we know he is LYING? Because he confessed on national TV to Lester Holt that he fired Comey because of Russia.

He is LYING to cover up his CRIMES.
