lol first it was bill maher, now sam bee? who will be next, olbermann? oh no!
Listen, I‚Äôm not saying Sam Bee was right for calling Ivanka a cunt, but for those of you comparing her and Roseanne Barr https://t.co/8AHo2wG7Jw
It's amazing that the people demanding Sam Bee get cancelled seem to think that there is some all powerful Mommy of Hollywood who needs to dole out fair cancellations so all the children are happy and feel equally loved

America‚Äôs Original Sin isn‚Äôt banging pornstars - it‚Äôs selling humans like animals; openly calling them apes. 

It‚Äôs why Roseanne was fired. 
It‚Äôs why Sam Bee won‚Äôt be. 
It‚Äôs what will end Trump, watch &amp; see.
IN SUM: The point isn't to get Sam Bee off the air. That would be a plus, but it's not expected--TBS isn't nearly as protective of its reputation as Disney, and Bee was hired specifically to make aggressive political commentary.

They're just maintaining the conservative brand.

Sam Bee should just say it's locker room talk. #BeBest
What bothers conservatives is not that Sam Bee called Ivanka a name. They just remember that the media set out to destroy Elizabeth Lauten for criticizing an Obama kid's outfit.
Isn't she sweet? @POTUS #RoseanneCancelled This crap must stop. It's abusive! Sam Bee you are a disgrace! https://t.co/hTBZ8LcDny

Let's also go more to Sam Bee's point. Ivanka claimed that her skill (since she has none) was to moderate daddy. Has she EVER stood up to trump and his vile comments? Ever? Instead she stays over in her photo op lane pretending she's a champion for women. https://t.co/3EpLMBVYgg
"If Bee doesn‚Äôt end up sacrificed to Roseanne Barr‚Äôs lunatic ego, do your part and watch her damn show next Wednesday and every Wednesday thereafter. She talks about policy and calls cunts cunts.

@TBSNetwork @FullFrontalSamB @TelevisionAcad I applaud Sam Bee for being the voice of the children who are being ripped from their parents arms. Yes, what she said was harsh but there are children's lives at stake and no one who can do anything about it seems to care. #UglyWords for #UglyTimes  #TeamBee
This all ends with Dre replacing Sam Bee, Bill Maher, Chelsea Wolf and every other political comedian‚Äôs airtime with that Beats ad.

The outrage over Sam Bee‚Äôs choice of words has been brought to you by the ‚Äúfuck your feelings‚Äù Trumpsters.
Watching @JohnKingCNN and company just fanning the vapors because Sam Bee called Ivanka the C-word. Quoting Erick Erickson "will be fine when Trump supporters start calling Clinton, Warren, &amp; Pelosi etc the same"   When?  Bitch Please, do a Google search. They made T-shirts.
And don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact that most of the people getting their undies in a twist about Sam Bee today were totes okay with Tr*mp boasting about grabbing women by the pussy. https://t.co/oEajEzkxoL

Gee, I wonder if Sam Bee knew exactly what she was doing, daring you to try to tie yourself in the knots required to equate disgusting intentional racist language with being rude.

It's very revealing.

Sam Bee shouldn't bother even acknowledging the furor because it's in transparently bad faith, but we shall see.
Seventh graders Sam Koopmeiners (TOMS), Matthew Dallalah (HOMS) and Ravlin Frantz (HOMS) are headed to the National History Bee in Atlanta, GA this weekend!

Congratulations and good luck to them!

I didn't quite care for Sam Bee's joke! I think it failed at being funny and was just mean to shock people, which is a pretty low form of comedy in my opinion. But I also do know the difference between that and what Roseanne said.

I am Extremely Fine with Sam Bee going after Ivanka Trump and could really do without performative liberal angst about ‚Äúbeing better‚Äù than our enemies. Going high does not apply when you‚Äôre dealing with wannabe fascists.

@TBSNetwork @WarnerBrosEnt Please DON‚ÄôT fire @iamsambee. She only said what millions of us are thinking. Not the same as Roseanne, Sam Bee did not disparage an entire group. Be brave.
@AnitaM86 @IvankaTrump People seem to forget that she is an adult and that she works in the administration. I haven‚Äôt seem Sam Bee show yet but I bet Sam was calling Ivanka out for ineptitude as member of this administration. Which in my mind is fair game &amp; not the same as what Roseanne did.
The big story today should be about the steel and aluminum tariffs we‚Äôre about to (foolishly) levy against Canada, Mexico, and the EU. But economics is a complicated and boring subject, and we have Roseanne and Sam Bee to focus on.

That's what I'm saying. When did the  "c" word become the "n" word of insults. Sam Bee says shit like that for the uninitiated. It's  a comedy show. And Sam Bee was saying to Ivanka, stand up for missing children! That was the point. Missing children. https://t.co/oHfNBVzIsf
