Lefty’s like Samantha Bee and those supporting what she said, not only about Ivanka but also about her innuendo regarding incest, are a stain on America. They are so nasty and vile. When I think of them, the green sh*t that came out of Regans mouth on the Exorcist is what I see.

Samantha Bee Called Ivanka a Feckless C**t and said do something about your dad separating undocumented families . But did she call Obama daughters that when he deported over 2Million illegal immigrants?

Samantha Bee violently attacks President Trump and his daughter Ivanka by spewing incestual slurs and vulgarity far far worse than any @TheRealRoseanne twitter bad joke.

I wouldn't have used that word. As a matter of comedic choice Samantha  Bee probably should NOT have used it either. (She could have made the  same valid point by saying "feckless pussy". It's a word Ivanka might  better understand since she learned it from her Daddy.)
@TwitchyTeam RACISM is not the same as telling the truth. Your Orange Boy has said much worse. Poor little Ivanka will survive.
Ivanka Trump is an empty Banana Republic gift card with security clearance.

I do NOT approve of Samantha Bee calling Ivanka a c***. 

Ivanka has neither the warmth nor the depth of a c***.
Samantha Bee is correct. Ivanka says she cares for children (how’d that Syrian children crusade go?), but only certain ones. She’s ineffective and basically useless. #Feckless
I think Samantha Bee's show should be cancelled. Not because of what she said about Ivanka Trump, because she isn't funny. I've tried watching on numerous occasions. I've given her chances. She's just not funny.
In addition to calling Ivanka Trump a “feckless c*nt,” Samantha Bee suggested she seduce her own father 

Had a conservative host said this about a Dem President’s daughter, this would now be Day 2 that he/she was out of a job. You know this is true https://t.co/2gMoFG9K5i

She went to discuss ending mass incarceration for non-violent drug offenders. It's commendable that she used her access for this. https://t.co/LzmhRrctbk
Calling on @TBSNetwork to FIRE Samantha Bee for her despicable remarks leveled at Ivanka Trump. 

There is no way a conservative would still have a job if they called  President Obama’s daughter the C word! 

The American people are calling on you to end the hypocrisy, NOW!

This morning, She called Ivanka a "feckless c-nt"  !!!
Still has her job.  No reprimand.  I love the left's hypocrisy https://t.co/eMTM7BfvdQ
Samantha bee tells a joke about trump’s racist immigration policies by using the C word to describe ivanka for being silent on issue. Would i use the C word? No. But I’m far more upset over trump’s racism, sexism and bigotry than one word of a comedian.
But ivanka trump *is* a feckless cunt!!!!!
@seanhannity It just does not get any nastier than this!! Decent women never ever use the C word! Bee is obviously classless and very jealous of Ivanka!! Bee is ugly inside and out!!
White House: Samantha Bee 'not fit for broadcast' after Ivanka Trump slur https://t.co/1L125amJF7
I just read the article from The Hill saying Samantha Bee “is getting slammed” for calling Ivanka Trump a feckless cunt. 

Right

It’s like 4 tweets condemning it.  And one of them is from Megyn Feckless Cunt Kelly

It’s a bullshit story trying to bait you.

Keep it up, Samantha
Feckless
adjective
ineffective; incompetent; futile:
Example: feckless attempts to repair the plumbing.

This describes Ivanka Trump to a T. The other word, I do not love.
TBS' Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c*nt" on her show last night.

So when is she being fired, publicly reprimanded for her abhorrent comments, or having her show cancelled?

Let us know, TBS!
@Ranjrz5 @washingtonpost Trump and Ivanka?
The double standard... https://t.co/yEoqXE3ddm
A reminder that the right's entire feigned outrage over Samantha Bee is because they desperately want to maintain the idea that Ivanka is the fair white maiden, the good one, the innocent flower of Camelot, which of course is all utter bullshit other than the white part

If a conservative called one of the Obama daughters what Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump, there would be boycotts and riots as far as the eye can see.

This is yet another example of the egregious double standard in our society.

Samantha Bee is a disgrace.

@CillizzaCNN She's a c*** and a traitor when Samantha Bee tells a lie then call her out so far she hasn't told Any Lies unlike Ivanka and the rest of her family
Folks, let's be clear: if Donald Trump called any woman what Samantha Bee called Ivanka, all of conservative media and evangelical leaders, to say nothing of his supporters, would unanimously be like, "Oh, yeah, it's totally fine to say the c-word, now. You didn't know?"
Samantha, you cant hold a candle to Ivanka. Your irreverence if aimed at a democrat president's daughter would have gotten you fired.

Ivanka Trump is the absolute worst. Donald is president because Ivanka wanted to be. She thought that he would lose and that she could come back as the "less abrasive" Trump and win. He won and she is milking it for all it is worth because she will never get another chance.
Roseanne called someone an “ape” and her life is ruined.

Samantha Bee calls Ivanka Trump a “feckless c*nt” and she gets to keep her show.

It's absolutely wrong to call Ivanka a "feckless cunt." She's a lot more than that. She's a feckless cunt WIFE. She's a feckless cunt SISTER. She's a feckless cunt DAUGHTER. And she's a feckless cunt BUSINESSWOMAN. She contains feckless cunt MULTITUDES.
If you think Samantha Bee calling Ivanka a C*nt is equivalent to Roseanne saying Valerie Jarrett is a product of the Muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes mating, then it's safe to say you're not only ignorant but a racist too!

#SamanthaBee #ThursdayThoughts
Wow! Deplorable Conservative Republicans just hit a new level of Retard thinking that Samantha Bee insulting Ivanka Trump is even close to Roseanne's racism. But then again every Donald Trump supporting Deplorable is a racist piece of shit so of course they defend racism.
