A3: CA state legislature is drafting a budget proposal that may or may not include #Health4All - Weâ€™re fighting to make sure it does. On 6/15 the budget will go to @JerryBrownGov for approval &amp; the chance to make CA the first state to ensure #Health4All. #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/HVFCZ74rIM
A2: Health care is a human right. Beyond giving Californians access to necessary health services, preventive health coverage can also help reduce health care costs in the long-term by addressing risks early, before they require costly treatment. #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/rgx7eNrHsw
A3: Weâ€™re working to make sure #Health4All is included in the CA budget. After that, it goes to @JerryBrownGov for approval, which would make CA the first state in the country to extend health care to all, regardless of immigration status. #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/Ig8hz858b8
Preventative care keeps our health costs low. Last minute emergency care only goes so far and is costing the state much more. We need #Health4All #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/ZtC53Z8BPj
Q1: Let's get started! What are the biggest barriers to health care access &amp; well-being that immigrant communities face?  #CAImmigrationChat #Health4All https://t.co/6CnLDrk9Hp
@AAAJ_LA @CALimmigrant A2: Health care is a human right. California has the opportunity to make history by becoming the first state that ensures EVERYONE has access to health care, regardless of immigration status. #Health4All #CAImmigrationChat @prachigu https://t.co/HMBbe2rNJE
A3: If #Health4All is included in the CA budget, @JerryBrownGov can make CA the first state to extend health care to all, regardless of immigration status. Make your voice heard by contacting the governorâ€™s office &amp; your state rep. in support of #Health4All. #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/XITmpnfGnf

A3. #Health4All adults is a legislative partnership by
@senricardolara (#SB974) &amp; @drarambulaAD31 (#AB2965). Both measures have gained support in their Senate and Assembly committees. #CAImmigrationChat #SJVHF
A3: CA has the opportunity to be the first state to provide healthcare for all regardless of status through the Health4All bills (AB2965 &amp; SB974). LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE BUDGET @JerryBrownGov #CAImmigrationChat #Health4All
#Health4All is critical for CA's immigrant communities. We have been a leader in protecting immigrant communities. Now is the time to ensure immigrants have access to healthcare regardless of status.  #CAImmigrationChat

A1: Not having access to health care is dangerous. So are anti-immigrant policies that cause lasting damage to the mental &amp; physical well-being of fellow Californians. No one should have to choose between health &amp; safety because of their immigration status. #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/1cBJtNGWCi

A2: It is an #injustice. So many immigrant adults are food chain workers, and it is a tragic irony that they are often the most #hungry and #foodinsecure, and lack access to #healthcare #Health4All #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/RwIjOc70lG

These barriers include the inability to access healthcare due to immigration status, cost, lack of information, culturally and linguistically competent materials and services, and our current political climate that threatens everyone's well being. #CAImmigrationChat https://t.co/ULHnu9iigs
