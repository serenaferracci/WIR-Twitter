This was taken last week by an activist. It shows a 'downed' dairy cow.

As soon as a cow cannot take any more pregnancies or her body cannot be milked any longer, she's useless to the industry and killed as a by-product. 

Drink cow's milk? You're paying for this!

After five or six years of repeatedly being impregnated and forced to produce abnormally large quantities of milk, most dairy cows are left exhausted and unable to keep up with demands made of them, so they are sent to the slaughterhouse to be killed for cheap meat. #WorldMilkDay https://t.co/iAUL9IB0BX
