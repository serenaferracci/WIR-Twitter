#BikeToWorkDay in Florida seems doable if you live in a dense urban area, with a commute that is less than 15 minutes in a car. I can see people showing up to work dripping in sweat and smelling like a gym. And, we won't talk about those who have to take I-4.
@brodiebikes @IBIKEHFX Time to get the old #Unibomber in for some TLC. Won't have it for #BikeToWorkDay, but I'm retired, and I'm an N+1 kinda guy. I have a spare bike. And a spare for the spare. And a spare for the spare for the spare. And 1 more, I think. https://t.co/WfWajnd3y5
