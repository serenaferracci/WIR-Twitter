So The Crow got far enough for concept art and make up tests. So it looks like it's the rights holders who are the actual problem. Director, star and financing all left.

@CBR IMO, physique &amp; acting-wise, Mamoa would've been great for "The Crow"; as long as that he's a new character as "The Crow," and not a retake on Eric Draven.

Off topic, but...

being that "The Crow" force(?) can empower different people, I'd like to see a female in the lead role.
