Me hearing saying Cudi “I’m just trying, to make you love me” on Ghost Town #Ye https://t.co/hKJS2cUWnr
@KingSalomon_ I'll have to listen a couple more times. First listen I was like meh, except Ghost Town I thought was really really awesome. I love Pablo and I feel like it's not up there with that but maybe my opinion will change
Ghost Town 🚨💥🔥
I’m on my 4th listen of #YE. I now feel like this is a compilation album of all his previous solo efforts. Each track sounds like it’s birthed from one of the 7 other albums. For example, “Ghost Town” is giving my MBDTF vibes while “Wouldn’t Leave” is giving me TLOP.
new favorite song. https://t.co/sCCFHSo8z7
TRACK 6 “GHOST TOWN” IN MY OPINION IS THE BEST SONG ON YE.

GHOST TOWN
Trying desperately to scrub "Ghost Town" from my ears, hopefully for eternity. #ye https://t.co/LBG0d09hti
'Ghost Town' off of @kanyewest 's new album is by far my fav
Easily the lowest point of ye is listening to Cudi try to sing on Ghost Town
Violent Crimes or Ghost Town could be my main summer jams #Ye
quem que canta em "Ghost Town" cês que são tudo fanzão especialista?
Ghost town
Ghost town... yes 🙌🏽
Ghost Town is the best so far.
If you’re only gonna listen to one song from the new Kanye, make it ‘Ghost Town’.
Is shake singing on ghost town? @YesJulz
Glad to see that Ghost Town is performing well. Loved it
Just listened to Ye for the second time all the way through. It was even better the second time around. Yikes and Ghost Town are instant classics there's no bad songs on the album

@DavidGrayMatter I feel bits of all his work coming through in it, Interesting. Sad that it's so short as I'm greedy and want more.. But It's got everything I like about his music in it so I'm happy, New one with Cudi next week too. Hopefully more like Ghost Town there
Ghost Town probably the best track idk.

Non riesco a smettere di ascoltarlo. #YE non so se il suo miglior album, ma sicuramente un capolavoro! GHOST TOWN è incredibile!! 🔥🔥 #kanyewest https://t.co/MsV8g3nDtB
Won’t lie.. #YE sounds low key after #daytona .. but “wouldn’t leave” “no mistakes” &amp; “ghost town” are peak #kanye.. overall I’m indifferent about the album.. unlike Daytona.. this feels short

Ghost Town sounds like it was prob a KSG outtake .
it was......okay? the first 3 songs are ugh; "wouldn't leave" and "ghost town" were decent bc they're more traditional kanye. then i did like "violent crimes" but it didn't really have anything new to it soo.....

C-, ye phoned this one in &amp; it wasn't even worth it 🤷🏻‍♀️
I cried as soon as I heard Cudi’s voice on Ghost Town
Like that sound like chance &amp; ty on all mine!! And Ty on violent crimes but need who singing at the end of ghost town
