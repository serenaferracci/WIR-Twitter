Between new Father John Misty and Ye, today is one hell of a #NewMusicFriday https://t.co/0TmSJ88I54
New @NekoCase and Father John Misty albums on the same day and I am in angsty indie-folk heaven.
@theneedledrop It's the worst time to release an album Mr Father John Misty. Ye is everywhere.
Funny to remember how Father John Misty was once a quiet folk artist only known by a few weirdos in my little corner of the internet.
New Music Friday is intense today:

The Internet
Kanye
GHOST
Mac Miller
Father John Misty
The 1975
Ferg

...WOW
@hilmonstah I feel like I need to legally change my name to I Was Talking About Father John Misty, Not Kanye at this point
Father John Misty lanza su nuevo álbum titulado “God's Favorite Customer”. https://t.co/XQxKj7G8Nb https://t.co/vAxgUKufIT
Kind of amazed that Father John Misty is gonna stroll into this week, release a great album, and cause minimal fuss. I wrote about how GOD'S FAVORITE CUSTOMER is a gut punch, and how FJM is suddenly one of music's most understated stars. https://t.co/vxPYiUNJVE
HELLOFKSKDKSK NEW FATHER JOHN MISTY ALBUM https://t.co/84inXRpUHE
hj é dia de father john misty krlhu
Guess I'm lucky to have avoided what surely must be the dozens of pseudo-intellectual 5,000-word think pieces already posted on what it really means to have a Father John Misty and Kanye album released on the same day.
Between Kanye and Father John Misty, I'm bracing myself for an onslaught of takes tomorrow, but I'm kind of interested to see how many people, without a typical FJM press cycle, suddenly will be able to admit he's one of our greatest working songwriters.

Me: h-
Some white guy: what do you know about music? Father John Misty’s new album is Real Music. Again, he exhibits a blistering commentary on the sorry state of humanity with his introspective musings on life, death, and religion. Beyoncé whom? What has she ever done for me

Dear Father John Misty, keep making beautiful music. Your decadence and decay is wonderful to listen to.

Father John Mistyは昨年ライブ観るまでは器用で耳心地が良いくらいの印象で、ハニベーもピュアコメも好きだったけどそんなに思い入れは無かった。だからこそ生で歌声聴いた時は衝撃で、度肝抜かれたんだよな。
