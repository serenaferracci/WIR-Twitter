Wow - incredibly proud, shocked and honoured to win the Emerging Leader Award. It’s all down to SSP in the first place, and the amazing people I’ve met through it. They’ve supported me, encouraged me, and given me opportunities to push myself and go all in. Thank you!! #SSP2018 https://t.co/ZcWNRSUyz4

In relation to our project on Metadata Evaluation, head to @CrossrefOrg’s #SSP2018 booth 212A to see their Participation Reports (Beta) tool which visualizes ten checks for metadata completeness for each of their 10,000 members.
Desire to publish Open Access is at the bottom of the list when it comes to considering where to publish according to Ivy Anderson at #SSP2018
Extra happy to be at #ssp2018 after spending the night in the wrong city due to the ground stop at O’Hare. Here we go! (A day late)
Glad @ElsevierConnect innovations in A.I. and ML found an audience at #SSP2018 https://t.co/nRtihWHCyG

There’s an audience outside the academic community for just about every article - mission changed to add “benefit of society” - Richard Gallagher of @AnnualReviews #ssp2018 https://t.co/ifJXaM1OUx
US research libraries want to build a new infrastructure for scholarly publishing (ie not the same commercial publishers) -- but US scholarly authors are not looking for such a change. -Ivy Anderson #SSP2018 https://t.co/ONeN3sPnng
At #openaccess session of #SSP2018. Disappointed but not surprising that they confuse gold OA with APCs. Maybe that's part of why we can't move to full OA faster
New (to me) descriptive term learned at #SSP2018 "Sci-Curious."
Here are my slides on "The Case for Applied Digital Humanities in Scholarly Communications" from today's #SSP2018 panel on #digitalhumanities, with the great @greenharr, @epoz, G. Pizzorno &amp; E Beaudin. #scholcomm #DH @JSTOR @ITHAKA_org

Libraries in the U.S. favor new infrastructure and moving to something more innovative than traditional journal; but authors are saying that the existing journal corpus is something they continue to value @ivyleander #SSP2018
Big take away from Pay it Forward: library budgets would not be enough for a fully #oa environment, but the math works when you add known grant funding.  #SSP2018
Ivy Anderson shares their study that revealed open access is least important of factors for researchers in choosing where to publish. My Q ... bc most just assume they can pay an APC anywhere so is not a distinguishing feature? #SSP2018
Elizabeth Hull @elizahull on the cost of open data. Just realized the @datadryad tagline: “Promoting scholarship through open data” #SSP18 #SSP2018 #SSPat40 https://t.co/FjfHXAwOhA
Uptake of OA in countries that have offsetting deals with publishers as high as 90% #SSP2018
95% of @biorxivpreprint submissions are author-classified as"new", rest are "confirmatory" or "contradictory" findings. Interesting snapshot of author opinions #ssp2018 https://t.co/h8ZcCTRi05
Hooray! Thanks @elizahull for announcing this awesome news at #SSP2018 #SSP18 https://t.co/nkznvr8EDf

Etienne Posthumus from Brill reviews key tenets for digital projects: keep data simple as possible, but not simpler; avoid hyped tools and formats unless it really fits; data preservation #SSP2018
... and now we start adding more things, notes @maryseligy: @ORCID_Org iDs, COI statements, article events, author contributions, data availability statements ...  #SSP2018
"In the ‘90s, we talked about marginalisation, oppression, racism, sexism, homophobia as defining features of exclusion. I then watched the transformation of those words into a generic word like diversity.” Very powerful and important point from @safiyanoble #SSP2018
Interesting contrast at #ssp2018 – @joergheber Editor-in-Chief at #plosone said that since implementing data sharing mandate they have published 96,000 manuscripts with data – contrast with Dina Paltoo at from #nih where only 12% of authors comply with data deposit policies.
Aligning publishers and repositories - move away from supplements to repositories @joergheber #SSP2018 #FAIR https://t.co/pwLqNRQI8z
Most CRM work with Dropbox, OneDrive other file storage tools can be used to update files pull data into CRM #ssp2018
Reminding me of question I pondered re library publishing forum discussions re learning what authors want. What if they don't want what librarians want? #SSP2018 #LPforum18 https://t.co/dsq8HvjBeX
