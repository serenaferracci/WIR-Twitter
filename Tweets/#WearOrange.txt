Republican philosophy of more guns creating less civilian gun violence is just asinine. Don‚Äôt let criminals, domestic abusers or mentally ill pass background checks. Limit high capacity military style weaponry. Invest in medicaid and social service programs #WearOrange

üî∂ NRA SOCIAL GOING ORANGE: While Everytown for Gun Safety has devoted close to no resources to making citizens safer, the NRA continues to be the world's leading gun safety organization since 1871. üì∏ Send us pics in your orange hunting and NRA gear to be featured. #wearorange https://t.co/16cE7srlZo
@NRA Instead of promoting your gear tell everyone to support: 
- Safe storage laws
- Universal background checks for Private sales
- Mandatory gun safety training
- Disarming domestic abusers
- Red Flag Laws
- Child Access Prevention laws
- Gun violence research
