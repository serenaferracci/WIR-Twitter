The fact Kim Kardashian would take her ass to talk about prison reform instead of deferring to people who have studied and fought for it for years/decades is why people don't like her family.
Democrats are viciously attacking Kim Kardashian for her visit to the White House, saying she wasn‚Äôt qualified to be there.

This is why people say that Christians are judgemental assholes.

Dear Bishop, Kim Kardashian wouldn't give her life to Christ if you come at her like this.

Before Kanye West married Kim Kardashian he was dating Amber Rose then after he made the switch he made a statement:

"I wanna be with a woman who can buy me the same type of gifts I can get her." 

Then it hit me.
