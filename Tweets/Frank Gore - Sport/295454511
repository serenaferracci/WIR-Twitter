Frank Gore speaking about his son, Frank Gore Jr:

"When he was a little kid playing outside with his bigger cousins, I knew that he would play football. But, if he doesn't want to play...as long as he gets his grades and does something positive in life, I'm alright with it." https://t.co/VE3GkdY6VV
