@patsfan49 @Patriots I agree with you! A lot of great players is missing on my list because of the character limit. Here’s some of them: Deion Branch, Troy Brown, Randy Moss, Richard Seymour, Willie McGinest, Kevin Faulk and Devin McCourty.

Devin McCourty called the new NFL national anthem policy "dumb." Noted it's not a compromise.
Why's everybody out here listing Devin McCourty on their all-time favorite Pats list as a Safety? Just to squeeze him on the list with Ty Law? lol Dude came in the league as a cornerback and still is one. He's just been playing safety cuz they've had nobody better...#smh #CMON

Devin McCourty said neither Kraft nor Belichick has addressed the new anthem policy with the team, and the players haven’t discussed it, either. But he anticipates that the new rule will cause some players to protest, just to spite the owners

Devin McCourty said he was disappointed in the anthem rule change.

"I just don't think that was the right way to try to lay the hammer down. The NFL is a group where you have owners and players, but it can work together."
