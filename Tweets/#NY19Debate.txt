#MedicareForAll isn't a political football for me, it's personal. When I was drilling water wells and wanted to go to college, I had to give up my health insurance. And with a family history of cancer, that was a difficult choice for me. #NY19Debate @WAMCNews https://t.co/Xsb5KqOjWJ

"Why do we not have universal background checks? Why are we still allowing weapons of war to be purchased? Because a small group of decision-makers are bought and paid for." #NY19Debate

"We have to figure out how we actually create jobs using green energy. Green energy creates jobs 12x faster than any other sector. I would transfer the 40 billion dollars we currently spend propping up the fossil fuel industry, as a way of creating jobs." @WAMCRadio #NY19Debate
Fun fact: When @brianflynnus says he’s been advocating for Medicare For All, it’s because his pharmaceutical company benefitted from it, not because it’s a position he personally agrees with. #ny19 #NY19Debate
"An attack on women's reproductive rights is an attack on their economic freedom." @WAMCRadio #NY19 #NY19Debate
My biggest takeaway after listening to the #NY19Debate, is that I will gladly take any of these candidates over Faso! #OneTerm

#NY19Debate undecided this morning, loving 95% of what I’m hearing from all the candidates, happy with the party cohesiveness. Not delighted with every candidate prepared to sacrifice @NancyPelosi who has done so much for our party. You don’t have to drag her for progressive cred
#NY19Debate we all agree. Fuck Faso

The Democratic candidates are offering their views on the #MeToo movement in the #NY19Debate
"We can't keep fighting battles of the past. It's not about are you a Bernie Democrat or a Hillary Democrat—I’m the kind of Democrat who wants to get things done, to pass Medicare for All, common sense gun safety reform, helping our young people work and live upstate" #NY19Debate

"Overwhelmingly immigrants create jobs in our communities. 1/3 of small businesses here in NY are owned &amp; operated by immigrants... We need to have a path to citizenship for ALL undocumented workers because that is what it needs to be an American." @WAMCRadio #NY19debate
We need to elect people that believe in climate change and we need to elect people that value the environment. We need to invest in clean energy and move away from fracking and fossil fuels. #NY19debate #WAMCdebate

“We must be human activists,” when it comes to fighting back against the evil Trump and his allies are pushing against immigrants. We have people coming to our border seeking asylum only to have their children ripped from their arms; that’s not who we should be. #NY19Debate
“As a young father a health insurance company took away my daughter’s life saving coverage - that’s something i’ll never forget...I’ve actually spent 4 decades taking on insurance companies and have won time &amp; again, so let’s talk abt who you can trust to pass #MFA.” #NY19Debate
