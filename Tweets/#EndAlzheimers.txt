#EndAlzheimers When my dad died 6 years ago, it was crystal clear that my mom had memory problems. She was not herself, but she looked the same. Her heart and soul are still the same, and I love her just the same. ‚ù§Ô∏è #FridayFeeling #MotherDaughter #love https://t.co/4JWZdcC1OO
I lost my Mom to Alzheimer‚Äôs &amp; I tell you it is a beast. It attacks the mind &amp; dignity of those we love. 
Let‚Äôs put aside our petty fights over things that don‚Äôt matter &amp; use our beautiful energy to slay this Dragon.

Want to end Alzheimer's? Did you know the gene for Alzheimer's is on the 21st chromosome? Who has three copies of the 21st chromosome? People with Down syndrome. If we valued their lives and supported research for Ds maybe we'd have a cure for both.  #EndAlzheimers
