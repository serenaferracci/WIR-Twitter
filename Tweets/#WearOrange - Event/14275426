On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor victims and survivors of #gunviolence &amp; show our resolve to stop future tragedies. On an average day, 96 Americans die from guns. Thatâ€™s horrific &amp; unacceptable. We need better &amp; more effective gun safety laws now. https://t.co/j8oGw24oYF
