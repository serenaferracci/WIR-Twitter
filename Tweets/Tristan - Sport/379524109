Kevin Love told me he left the bench in OT to argue the call on Tristan, walking onto the court to get in the officials' eyeline, not in reaction to any scuffle &amp; before it even broke out. Video (via @bballbreakdown) seems to back this up; not sure if it will matter to the league https://t.co/JeHmd6Fl2p
