From a very early age, I was diagnosed with allergies and asthma. But God’s diagnosis did not line up with the doctors because when I turned 16, God healed me. That’s why I will give God the Glory and  the praises for the rest of my life.. #BeBraveShareYourStory
#BeBraveShareYourStory I suffer from bipolar depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other health issues. I wish there was a cure-all, but there isn't. I am strong because of God's mercy.
Everyone you meet is fighting a battle  you know nothing about.... 

Need proof?

Bullied abused at school &amp; still fighting the effects, seeking support for PTSD from more recent events but none seems available - fighting for #autistic human rights &amp; for us to receive appropriate Mental health support - this is only reason I’m still here #BeBraveShareYourStory
Several bouts of chronic depression &amp; anxiety. Panic disorder so bad I nearly took my own life a few times. Lost a few jobs. Bit of self-harm. 

Married, roof over my head, great job, I get to share my passions with the world, book deals in the works.

Depression's plagued me since 16. Kept me from finishing school, holding jobs, keeping relationships &amp; taking care of myself. The instability caused homelessness. I feel ugly inside and out. I just want to be normal.  #BeBraveShareYourStory
Social anxiety,generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive, depression...but a big smile and soccer mom bravado to hide it all you’d never know @TheOtownClown #BeBraveShareYourStory
I believed suffering in silence was a strength.

Little did I know, not asking for help was my greatest weakness.

I suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and depression.

Be strong and ask for help.

It takes a GREAT deal of strength to open up about certain issues.  If someone is telling you something is wrong LISTEN and don’t make them feel their problem is small. I joined a support group and have never been happier! Help is there when you need it  #BeBraveShareYourStory https://t.co/ItkrkMs4Lo

My dad killed himself on my 10th birthday and I spent 30 years getting back at him by being as miserable as possible. 

Three attempts, and 20 years later, I finally asked for help. 

I’ve spent the last 3.5 years happier than I ever thought possible.
