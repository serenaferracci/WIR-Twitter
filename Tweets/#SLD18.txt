Very cool that *India's* PM keynotes at #SLD18 . Shows increasing geo-political influence in the region. https://t.co/2wgtXjvbyx
For what it's worth, security at the Shangri-La is exceptionally well handled by the Singaporean authorities. #SLD18 https://t.co/X3O73LAgcd

Excellent, riveting, visionary speech, say people on my table. They are from Sri Lanka, Phillipines, US, Indonesia, Singapore. Modi at #SLD18
Relevance of Modi speech: We can now imagine a post-American world that isn‚Äôt dominated by China, but instead anchored by ASEAN and middle powers, from India to Australia, Japan and South Korea. Great job #SLD18
Modi uses that much expected term ‚Äòrules-based‚Äô order. These rules and norms must be based on the consent of all, not the power of a few. When nations make international commitments, it must uphold them. Hint to US or China or both (on Iran or SCS)? #SLD18
Inclusiveness, openness and ASEAN-centrality: Modi setting out his Indo-Pacific vision which is not bound by geography #indopacificiswhatstatesmakeofit #sld18
Hello Singapore! Good to be back for the Shangri La Dialogue #SLD18. Travelling with @shekhar19541 was a bonus!

Overall, this Modi #SLD18 speech reflected the continuity in Indian foreign policy -- a more active India, but one whose approach to the world remains consistent

India PM Modi at #SLD18 makes a passionate account of #IndoPacific : security and growth for all in the region. Emphasis on India as #ASEAN strategic partner @EUinASEAN https://t.co/r5cXZp2CRs
From what I gather, Modi staking India's strong claim to Indo-Pacific stewardship, if not leadership (alongside key states), based on geography, ancient connection with SE Asia, burgeoning r'ship w other powers/middle powers and championing of global rules #sld18
SecDef meeting with Singapore and Vietnam on his first day in town. Last year he was fielding a lot of "You're saying the right thing, but where is the White House on [insert key issue]." Likely to hear that chorus again, with feeling, this year.  #SLD18 https://t.co/EPNIcbvafw

Modi at #SLD18 talking ASEAN a fair bit. Just as he did in Indonesia, ensuring ASEAN centrality is highlighted as important component of Indo-Pacific talk (addressing concerns in region re where they fit in)
In just a few hours we'll welcome heads of state, defence chiefs and top analysts to Singapore for the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue - Asia's premier security summit. Follow online using #SLD18. https://t.co/8W9jn1wczB https://t.co/PYaJHFY6aq
.@narendramodi argues for rules based order in Asia. Advocates equality for all nations irrespective of size and strength, as well as freedom of navigation and commerce. #SLD18 https://t.co/KciWPaWUjO

PM Modi speech at #SLD18 ends.  An interesting exercise in tightrope walking between India's ties with US, China and Russia. Puts ASEAN at the centre of any Indo-Pacific initiative. (Doesn't mention the Quad.)

Most interesting thing about Modi speech: barely any mention of United States, or Trump #SLD18

.@NarendraModi: Indian Ocean carries 90% of India's trade and energy and sources, and is a lifeline of global commerce. #SLD18
Modi at #SLD18 talking ASEAN a fair bit. Just as he did in Indonesia, ensuring ASEAN centrality is highlighted as important component of Indo-Pacific talk (addressing concerns in region re where they fit in)
Modi at #SLD18: after quite a while in a major speech, he embraces the term "strategic autonomy" (sthg prev 2 govts had done). Mentions Russia rel (also way to show it's part of India's Asia strategy), then US, then China.
India‚Äôs relationship with #ASEAN countries has moved from dialogue partners to strategic partners in last 25 years, @narendramodi tells #SLD18 https://t.co/h1uwj7K66q

Modi at #SLD18
Was guarded while he clearly talked about China when he said disputes should be solved based on Intl law &amp; not might, respect for sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity. India wants cooperation not conflict. Doesn‚Äôt want great power rivalry in Asia.

Modi concludes with the Panchamrit. But plenty in that speech echoed Nehruvian themes. #SLD18

India's vision for #IndoPacific as delineated by PM Modi at #SLD18
üî∏Asean centrality
üî∏Rules based order that applys to all
üî∏Equal access to common spaces of air and sea
üî∏No proectionism, RCEP must be ‚Äòcomprehensive‚Äô
üî∏Connectivity should not led to strategic competition https://t.co/KJbYydlzIE

Amazing how #Modi can be such a global statesman abroad, while feisty and populist at home. How I wish #Duterte &amp; #Trump could pull that chameleon off üòÇ #SLD18
"Buy-in to the "Indo-Pacific", with its nod to the Quad, sends a clear message that powers, apart from the US, are committed to a rules-based order and international law," writes @LynnKuok. Great piece, Lynn! #IndoPacific #SLD18 @STopinion https://t.co/IOOmoBPIp9
