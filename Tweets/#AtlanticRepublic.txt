“How many unicorns do you need to see before you believe unicorns exist” -@franklinleonard to those who think POC films like #BlackPanther are “unicorns” #AtlanticRepublic https://t.co/2gsCNvLsbe
Part of our problem today is that we're stuck in toxic, weaponized vocabulary, author and @YaleLawSch professor @amychua tells @TheAtlantic's @JeffreyGoldberg at #AtlanticRepublic
"The great irony about the term "American Exceptionalism" is that it did not originate as a compliment.", @DavidFrum, Senior Editor, The Atlantic #RecordingTheRepublic @AtlanticLive #atlanticrepublic
"The American Dream to me is about opportunity - once we are given the opportunity it's about making the best use of those opportunities...but I feel like we should make it more about a group effort and help each other out." #AtlanticRepublic https://t.co/jQ5UOsLwfJ
.@tedlieu on politics: “Everything seems impossible...until it happens” referring to LGBTQ marriage and legalization of marijuana in the context of #MarchforOurLivss and gun reform #AtlanticRepublic. Interesting to think about what’s yet to come.
@davidfrum &amp; @AndyRichter with @alisonstewart as a great moderator is kinda an odd combination at @AtlanticLIVE recoding the republic event, but I'm loving it! #AtlanticRepublic
.@JeffreyGoldberg: We didn't go to school in a time when students would go to administrators asking them to limit free speech. -- Fascinating how times have changed #AtlanticRepublic
Gardener metaphor is ok “if there’s a lot of gardens. But you have whole countries where Facebook = the Internet. There’s only 1 gardener there, and his name is Mark.” - Cindy Cohn @EFF #AtlanticRepublic
There is enormous hate and racism in this country, says @amychua. You should see the emails I get. But we have to get smarter about how we try to change that. #AtlanticRepublic
@AndyRichter ? What the fuck?  Who cares? #atlanticrepublic
I struggle with the binary framing we often fall into of the internet being good or bad. That's a reductive view that can be applied to any topic, says Cindy Cohn of @EFF at #AtlanticRepublic
Who has access to your information? Cindy Cohn of @EFF delves into ownership and third party access to our digital data #AtlanticRepublic https://t.co/mUz50UHbPK
We have a rich diversity in this city. The question is how we best fit the needs of the communities that are a part of the fabric here, says  @MayorOfLA Office's @DrLindaLopez #AtlanticRepublic

For people in this country to stand away from immigration is like @kfc deciding not to sell chicken. I don’t understand it. @AndyRichter @AtlanticLIVE #atlanticrepublic @ucla https://t.co/CwrCbAp7HE
"there are things to learn from other developed nations" @AndyRichter on #AmericanExceptionalism #AtlanticRepublic
The point of the super-group idea is that you can keep your sub-group identity but the key is a connective tissue, in this case as fellow Americans -@amychua #AtlanticRepublic https://t.co/PlG8lv6vXB
"The Trump presidency is not a presidency—it's a TV show," says @AndyRichter. "There are teasers, cliffhangers...the notion of truthfulness does not matter. It's a story." #AtlanticRepublic
@davidfrum says: The ethical implication of predicting the post-Trump era is that you are a spectator not a participant in our political system #atlanticrepublic

At #AtlanticRepublic, @alisonstewart is interviewing @franklinleonard about Hollywood, diversity, and representation, and it’s role in American democracy. https://t.co/fLZXsuykCt
One movie to watch out for, according to @theblcklst's @franklinleonard: Crazy Rich Asians. It's going to make a mint and mint a bunch of stars. #AtlanticRepublic
The difference is easy to understand that he can almost become an organ for Don Giovanni. #AtlanticRepublic

We have to look abroad to connect education and the labor market, says @UCLA's @PedroANoguera. He calls Germany as a prime example: there, young people enter technical fields while still in secondary school. #AtlanticRepublic

The truth of free speech, says @CaitlinPacific, is that it allows repugnant things to be said. "Aren't there some things that are so reprehensible that they have no place on a college campus?" That's why, she adds, she can't be a free-speech absolutist. #AtlanticRepublic
