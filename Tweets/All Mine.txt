You cannot mock God &amp; go scot free. God keeps His promises of retribution &amp; vengeance on all His enemies &amp; evil doers.When He is angry, who can withstand His fury? Our God is just. See 2Kings9.&amp; in Deut32:35 God reiterates: It is Mine to avenge; I will repay.

@meecz_ All mine ft Ty Dolla $ign and Valee
there are some incredible highs on this album. there's the minimal Yeezus-esque darkness of the first three tracks, but it's the warm, celebratory tones of the last four and their elevated choruses that really bring it all home

and there are abysmal lows. delete All Mine. please
I’m already tired of these bars from ye. I’m at track 4. The beats are good... but like all mine is so irritating. So far it’s not like Daytona.

It is not mine however I think we all would agree that paying more than 2x face value of the tickets is ridiculous!
Had a lovely thought this morning....there's a man out there I will one day fall in love with, he's out there right now, existing, living his life, and I'm living mine and there's really no rush, things happen, things unfold, and it's all ok.
THAT'S VALLEE WITH THE HIGH ASS VOICE ON "ALL MINE"... MIND BLOWN #YE
Like that sound like chance &amp; ty on all mine!! And Ty on violent crimes but need who singing at the end of ghost town
