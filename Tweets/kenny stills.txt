Kenny Stills basically saying he would not like being a Free Agent because the protests.  

Dez Bryant didn't protest once. He was the great WR Dallas ever had. 

Why isn't he on a team? 

Racism I guess 😂
Devante Parker - 3 year tease

@RobertC76155404 @walker828 @ShannonSharpe Yeah at first I didn’t realize what they do but I’m pretty sure players like Kenny Stills Malcom Jenkins and many other have done that I know for sure in Miami and I’m guessing Philadelphia because that’s where Malcom plays

Kenny Stills, who has done a lot of good work in the community, said he hasn't decided how he will handle new anthem policy. He is the one remaining holdover from last year's team who often didn't stand for anthem, making clear it was a stand on social issues.
@WingfieldNFL Devante Parker-3yr average wr
Danny Amendola-slow slot
Albert Wilson-unproven for how $$
Jakeem Grant-why aint he starting yet?
Kenny Stills-1 trick slot pony 

Those that get upset over the observations cant handle the truth

“Look at what’s happening to the guys who protest. That’s my answer.”
Kenny Stills has not decided whether he will kneel this year. Clearly not happy about the rule change but isn’t ripping the league.

Kenny Stills on the anthem policy: I think you guys (media) about the anthem policy. I just want to continue to focus on the work I've been doing
@TangoandCashFF But some players just refuse to rise in ADP no matter how many people tout them. Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson are just going to stay a few rounds too cheap all offseason
