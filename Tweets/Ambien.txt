Roseanne Barr says she was "Ambien tweeting" when she published those controversial posts on Twitter yesterday  -- Sanofi, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ambien, responded saying "racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."
To be clear, I have studied #Ambien for several years, publishing multiple scientific papers on the subject, and have never, I mean never, seen racism as a side effect.
Wow... when a pharmaceutical company throws shade.... Roseanne blames her racist tweet on Ambien. The drug maker responds: "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.‚Äù
The name Ambien is thought to come from the word "ambient" or similar words in French. Ambient does not mean "prone to making racist comments," but it does mean "of the surrounding area or environment."

One of my sisters take Ambien and I literally just got off the phone with her while she was on her meds &amp; she said ‚ÄúSo Roseanne got fired because she compared two siblings‚Äù I said no girl the one the right is an Ape! She replied ‚Äú oh I thought them were twin sisters‚Äù.  Ambien https://t.co/ZxjdVvKpUn
Dear Ivanka Trump, 

I'm sorry I called you a souless joysnatcher and accused you of imprisoning poor mothers in your factories for fun and profit without also mentioning you are a horrid twat. Forgive me. 

I apologize. I was on Ambien.
Oh shit, the Ambien is making me tweet this. https://t.co/spcJS4xRmC

Thanks for watching tonight's show and remember, talk to your doctor before taking Ambien. #SamanthaBee https://t.co/T1f1BqwLr2
Absolutely. She made racist tweet. Apologized for it. Said she‚Äôs off Twitter. Gets back on Twitter. Blames Ambien she and #45 @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne are one in the same. WTH what‚Äôs the ‚Äúreal‚Äù truth? https://t.co/XmlkXqe6dJ
#RedPill of the day: Anyone else realize that @therealroseanne has single handedly catapulted Valerie Jarret and Snopes into the public conscious in 1 afternoon? Why is this great? Think about the redpill process. [Read below]

JR Smith should blame Ambien
Oh shit, the Ambien is making me tweet this. https://t.co/spcJS4xRmC
@Vic_Rollison She‚Äôs even tried to blame the offending tweet on having taken Ambien (a sleeping pill) beforehand. I understand that the manufacturer of Ambien has found it necessary to publicly announce that their product does not cause racism.

Ok. I'm truly over it with this mess. First the homophobic posts, then the 9/11 "Truther" posts, and now this nonsense with manipulating images. And watch @JoyAnnReid blame this on a hacker... or better yet... Ambien. It's time for her to go too. https://t.co/MDttdpM50p

Not to stick up for a pharmaceutical company but I took an ambien last night and still thought what Roseanne did was hurtful and stupid. Then I ate a whole turkey.

People are asking me How can i be black and still support Roseanne after the mistake she made, um the same way y‚Äôall still support Bill Maher after he said House Nigger and mocked black slaves, he still has a show and he wasn‚Äôt on Ambien . https://t.co/RlI0pAHmgT
@newscientist How about a combination of mental illness, other prescription drugs, alcohol &amp; Ambien contributing to a warped sense of reality &amp; absence of judgment in combination with the fact that we are all a product of a culture steeped in racism which reveals itself under such conditions?
Thank you. I'm going to skip the ambien. https://t.co/rH86SgXsYD
JR Smith gonna blame that play on Ambien
You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose but you can't blame your racist tirades on ambien.

Who knew #Ambien was causing all our problems... #Roseanne #ByeFelicia https://t.co/1U0hgRcSdI
Side effects of Ambien include rapid heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, and bouts of racism. If you have a pre-existing bigot condition, Ambien may not be right for you. Republicans should not take Ambien. Talk to your doctor about Ambien today.
Oh shit, the Ambien is making me tweet this. https://t.co/spcJS4xRmC
Hey Don, take your Ambien with you!   You may need them in hell, because Satan won't let you sleep! https://t.co/wHIdyyzwVk
Roseanne blamed Ambien for her racist tweets and gave a halfhearted apology. Sadly, Donald Trump didn‚Äôt have to blame anything or apologize for calling NFL players ‚Äúsons of bitches‚Äù, African nations ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù and Mexicans ‚Äúrapists‚Äù because the GOP applauded him for it.
A spokeswoman for Sanofi, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ambien, said in response to Roseanne Barr's tweets about taking the sedative: "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication." H/T @BBCNews

@DebraMMason1 You‚Äôre right. I didn‚Äôt either. I just thought it was really odd that she said she had a weird Ambien episode and then claims to remember what she was thinking during it. That has never happened
@SethMacFarlane The Ambien is making me watch that on repeat.
#HighAdventure #GummiberryJuice
G*ddamn it its 2:00 in the morning and I just took some Ambien - 

I'm all of a sudden getting the urge to put on a good and cape and go out and set a cross on fire.  

Maybe I should just run for office as a blk racist GOP instead ü§î

Naw no Gop'er would ever vote for a blk man.
Soz 4 annexing Sudetenland guys. On Ambien, FWIW.

@SethMacFarlane Lucky for you, you did not take Ambien on Memorial Day. I‚Äôve heard that if you do you may end up saying racist stuff.

5. Big Pharm and how they view people who take their drugs. 

Thanks Roseanne!

There is nothing more racist than claiming you carry around hot sauce in your purse just to get a black vote. Must of been on Ambien when y‚Äôall voted for her.  You hate Roseanne and Trump but voted for an open racist. liberals need to lay off the Ambien https://t.co/lfhiOHcWRN

People try to compare what Potus Trump said in private that was secretly taped, something he would never say in public &amp; what Roseanne said off the cuff on ambien to the premeditated, rehearsed, degrading, hateful words of Samantha Bee. No comparison. https://t.co/GwLItDgTOr

@WaltzingMtilda Joy was on Ambien.
To be clear, I have studied #Ambien for several years, publishing multiple scientific papers on the subject, and have never, I mean never, seen racism as a side effect.
@RickIngraham Thanks, Rick.  May we suggest a little less Ambien?
