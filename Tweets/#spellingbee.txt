English is a beautiful mess and has incorporated words from all sorts of languages. 

The most common language of origin for #spellingbee words is Latin.

The easiest is Late Greek.

The most difficult, albeit with a small sample size, is Hebrew.

Take note that yesterday‚Äôs Scripps National #SpellingBee was won by spelling the word KOINONIA! This GREEK word meaning communion or fellowship (sharing together) is a common word of the church but all people want to belong where they are loved. #ShareJesus #ShareLove #Fellowship

Yo @JHarden13,

#spellingbee Congratulations! Definition of koinonia - 1 : the Christian fellowship or body of believers. 2 : intimate spiritual communion and participative sharing in a common religious commitment and spiritual community. Would be nice if our political leaders knew the meaning. https://t.co/lt33iPVhJU
