@freshxdesign @CalebHowe @StephenGutowski @megynkelly Massive hypocrisy and double standard. Roseanne sends stupid tweet at 2am, show immediately canceled, 100s of cast and crew out of work. Sam Bee calls president's daughter a c*** on primetime national TV, not only keeps her job but gets an award. https://t.co/V8ITcTk2M1
