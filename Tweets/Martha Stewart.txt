BREAKING: Trump just said he may pardon Martha Stewart and commute disgraced former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's sentence. Stewart did a spin-off series of The Apprentice and Blagojevich was on Celebrity Apprentice. He’s laying the groundwork so he can really abuse pardon powers.
Would you pardon Martha Stewart?
If Martha Stewart told criminal con-man Trump to shove his 'pardon' up his wretched orange ass, she'd go down in history with righteous heroes like August Landmesser, who refused to give Hitler the "Sieg Heil" salute during a Nazi rally in Hamburg on June 13, 1936. @MarthaStewart

Rich white people like Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich routinely get away with egregious white collar crimes within a justice system stacked in their favor. On the rare occasion they get convicted, a Presidential pardon awaits. Meanwhile, poor blacks get no breaks. Ever.

Dinesh D’Souza—Election law violations

Trump is reportedly considering pardoning/commuting sentence for:

Martha Stewart—Obstruction of justice

Rod Blagojevich—Corruption

@realDonaldTrump’s message is clear.
I can see #democrats inventing reasons why its wrong for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump considering #pardons for @MarthaStewart #RodBlagojevich https://t.co/WNb24dgfP2 #MAGA
The people Trump wants to pardon are guilty of the types of crimes Trump fears most.

👉 Dinesh D’Souza - Campaign finance violations
👉 Rod Blagojevich - Political corruption
👉 Joe Arpaio - Civil rights violations
👉 Martha Stewart - Insider trading
👉 Scooter Libby - Perjury
