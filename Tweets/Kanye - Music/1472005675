@2012apocaIypse @dannygmanage @DonnyCarson @KarynSpencer @wyntermitchell @ReignOfApril Azealia shares opinions just like Kanye but when Kanye does it he’s being “artistic” but when Azealia does it she’s being mean THAT is a double standard. Kanye was rude to Taylor Swift and no one said anything. Ya’ll don’t hold that man accountable for anything. Just stop.
