@JohnBrennan 'The former intelligence officers believe that John Brennan and James Clapper used highly classified intelligence channels to create a trail of fake evidence linking Trump to Russia.  It appears highly likely that Joseph Mifsud was a MI6 asset.'

Former CIA director, John Brennan, in WaPo compared Trump to ‚Äúcorrupt, incompetent ‚Ä¶ demagogues,‚Äù  refers to his foreign policy approach as ‚Äúuninformed,‚Äù ‚Äúimpulsive‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù

Retweet if you agree that Trump doesn't have the brains he was born with.

"His ad hoc and frequently impulsive approach to national security is short-sighted and dangerous, as allies and partners are left uncertain about U.S. strategy and objectives."

‚ÄúMen of morality &amp; ethics ‚Äù don‚Äôt vote for the Communist Party at the height of the Cold War.

LIKE YOU DID @JohnBrennan in 1976 when you voted for Gus Hall.

In 1976 the USSR wanted to destroy America and you were a fellow-traveller.

You are a disgrace.

12. Who was the CEO of the Analysis Corporation (TAC) when these files were accessed? John O Brennan himself. Now mind you, he was then adviser to Obama on foreign policy and intelligence issues and had actually briefed the media on behalf of the Obama campaign that very month.

This opinion piece from John Brennan is a perfect summary of Trump ... scathing, but true. https://t.co/ZFAe7fnz3K
"McCarthyism" was flinging impossible to disprove charges at people.

John Brennan, THE FORMER HEAD OF THE CIA, is now flinging innuendo at the president AND THERE'S NO WAY to independently disprove it BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW AND CANNOT KNOW what he knows or PURPORTS to know.

John Brennan and James Clapper used highly classified intelligence channels to create a trail of fake evidence linking Trump to Russia.

The only entity that could have coordinated the entire operation was the Traitor Obama White House. https://t.co/6U4oQnhpQs
Liberals hate Trump so much that they are praising a guy who

‚û° Spied on all of them

‚û° Started civil wars in Libya, helping it become a failed state

‚û° Helped kill civilians

‚û° Lied to congress

That's John Brennan

Don't forget who he is!
