I’m absolutely disgusted with all the Kanye love. It proves why this man is dangerous. The shit he spew is all okay now for an album that’s maybe 60 mins long.

#YE is nuts. Kanye's happiest, most hopeful...and PRETTIEST album by a fucking mile. Rich, melodic production that's confidently sparse when it needs to be and goes widescreen when called for. Few brush strokes, but they're big, and bright, and have a million colors in them.

#YE #Kanye
Listen man, I'm listening to that Kanye West
#YE is nuts. Kanye's happiest, most hopeful...and PRETTIEST album by a fucking mile. Rich, melodic production that's confidently sparse when it needs to be and goes widescreen when called for. Few brush strokes, but they're big, and bright, and have a million colors in them.
All the new Kanye stuff reminds me of Online Ceramics. https://t.co/g2Dcd15Bsg
Kanye West thanks Nicki Minaj for writing for him on his new album, “Ye” by closing his album with her voice-mail.

Bruh, these Kanye bars are all types of cringe. And he swore these rhymes were that business. If you flew to Wyoming for 7 tracks of mediocrity...oof. https://t.co/OoSg038IqM
No, we will not be listening to Kanye's new album, no matter how fire it may be, this is why Kidz Bop exists.

This album is already a piece of art.. Kanye always finds a way to outdo himself when you think there is nothing left to do. Always. #YE
The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.

Kanye made Pusha start beef with Drake so we’d stop talking about how he likes Trump, then sent Kim to meet w Trump so it looks like she’s the one that turned him #imshleep
