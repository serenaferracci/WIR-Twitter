Today is #NationalDonutDay. Get that donut when celebrating #NationalLeaveTheOfficeEarlyDay. Chew well to avoid celebrating #HeimlichManueverDay. After eating your donut, raise a glass for #WorldMilkDay. June 1 is chock full of significant celebrations: https://t.co/WsWNidWrSW https://t.co/ETCaTtsZdN
