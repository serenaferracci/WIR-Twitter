@DanaJacoviello @MiraSorvino   This is Nathan Larson.  He is an admitted rapest and pedophile.  He is running for congress in Charlottesville, VA.  He believes that the Violence Against Women Act should be repealed because he says women are property.  He must not get elected. https://t.co/M6ZsGpyDEM
