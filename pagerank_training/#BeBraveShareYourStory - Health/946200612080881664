It takes a GREAT deal of strength to open up about certain issues.  If someone is telling you something is wrong LISTEN and donâ€™t make them feel their problem is small. I joined a support group and have never been happier! Help is there when you need it  #BeBraveShareYourStory https://t.co/ItkrkMs4Lo
