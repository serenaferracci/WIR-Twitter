@Larry_Beech @BloodyMarxist @2xwide_dreaming @ChuckRossDC @Judgenap This IG report is going to be over the Clinton Email investigation. I expect the IG to say there was SOME wrong doing. I don't expect him to call the FBI out on everything they did wrong. I'm also pretty sure Mueller gave Comey immunity or he wouldnt be blabbing  on his book tour
