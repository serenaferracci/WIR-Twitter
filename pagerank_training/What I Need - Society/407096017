I'll say what I said in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015: No one is leaving the euro. No one's getting kicked out. Eurozone will add new members. Euro is rock solid. You only need to know one thing. The euro has never been an economic project. It has always been political. https://t.co/WCWXl41KFR
