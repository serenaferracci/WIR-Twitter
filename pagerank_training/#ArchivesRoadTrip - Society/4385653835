Who wants to go on an #ArchivesRoadTrip with #EleanorRoosevelt? In July 1933, ER drove her new Plymouth w. Lorena Hickok from D.C. up to eastern Canada, stopping in Lowell, MA, the Rivi√®re-du-Loup, &amp; Quebec where they met with the Premier Taschereau. https://t.co/mL99qNg450 https://t.co/3F7XupoQTR
