@MotorTrend @StreetOutlaws Some fast ass cars out there with the new season! Monza, Daddy Dave, new Murder Nova, the Crow!!!! Those cars were flying down the track! I saw Derek with the Silver Unit back, &amp; heard him say he felt fast enough to hit the list, after a pedal contest with Kye Kelly! OKC is back!
