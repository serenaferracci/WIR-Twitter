Dinesh D'Souza:

Believes liberals caused 9/11

Thinks it is wrong for women to want to be equal to men

Is against same-sex marriage

Mocked the Stoneman Douglas students

But Ted Cruz thinks he's a "powerful voice for freedom". 

We hate him because he's a POS, Ted, like you. https://t.co/7thPawW8i4
