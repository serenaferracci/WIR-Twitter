We've worked tirelessly &amp; mine was a contribution to the team's goals. I look back to the season with a bitter sweet feeling. I won individual accolades &amp; wish this could have been the Club titles. I'm grateful for the recognition &amp; thankful to all who supported me throughout🙏🏻 https://t.co/aKzux2buDx
