\title{Twitter Trending Topic Classification}
\author{MES: Maria Ludovica Costagliola - Emanuele De Santis - Serena Ferracci}

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{The Web Information Retrieval course allowed us to develope the described project.
It is about classification of topics that are trending of twitter in a given moment. We have dealt 
with (i) text based classification using single tweets (ii) network based classification exploting the 
graph stracture of Twitter. 

The used dataset is composed by tweets divided by trending topics. 
We classify the trending topics into 8 categories: \textit{Event, Health, Movie, Music, Politics, Science, Society} and \textit{Sport}.

The first approach gives good result in terms of precision and recall. Instead, the second approach 
does not give conclusive results because it require too many resources to be implemented on a single machine.
